Embraer,Business,Economy Class,Frankfurt to London City,August 2023,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,,,✅ Trip Verified |  Late boarding led to a one hour flight leaving two hours late. A single BA staff member turned up to board a full flight shortly before the flight was due to depart. There had been no previous announcement of the delay. Once on board the captain blamed Frankfurt ground staff for delaying takeoff when clearly late boarding had resulted in a missed departure slot.
,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Lyon,August 2023,,,,1.0,1,no,,,✅ Trip Verified | As usual the flight is delayed. BA try to blame someone for the inability and incapacity of delivering what they sell. Why don't you hire enough personnel to fulfil your staff demand. 
Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Hong Kong,July 2023,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,5.0,,✅ Trip Verified |  I had the most fantastic BA Flight today. The cabin crew in my seat zone 6D were of the best I have experienced. Although the 777 had the old style rear/front seating - it was comfortable and felt open and spacious. BA have done great things with the menu - it was nice not to have to eat breakfast food on the pre-arrival meal into HKG at 1730PM local time having left London at 2200 the night before. The dinner offering was equally ample and delicious. The inflight entertainment had a great collection of TV and current films and the inflight map was first rate. Previously not a huge BA fan - but after this 12 hour flight I could only recommend it without reserve. I flew the new BA suite in J class on a recent Delhi to London flight and enjoyed that product (although I felt it slightly more cramped ) but I think BA have stepped up with really comfortable bedding and food and very friendly crew who engaged throughout the flight in the best way. Couldn't recommend BA more on this flight today
,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Gatwick to Montpelier,July 2023,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,,,✅ Trip Verified |  Couldn’t book in online. Arrived at check in to find we had been bumped off due to overselling. No BA staff available. Very helpful Gatwick staff got us a bus to LHR and a flight to Toulouse. Had knock in effect on our car booking and sharing as the rest of family had been able yo board original flight. Airlines should be legally stopped from selling seats twice.
Boeing 787-8,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Mumbai,July 2023,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4,yes,3.0,,"✅ Trip Verified | London Heathrow to Mumbai in a Boeing 787-8 in Business Class. The lounge near Terminal 5, Gate B36 at Heathrow was outstanding in its service and offerings. It provides us just the right frame to relax in before boarding as the departure was delayed by almost 2 hours. The 787-8 on our flight featured the older Club World seating. Not the best in class but comfortable enough. I hear that the new Club Suites configuration is far superior. British Airways onboard service was outstanding in every respect. All in all, a very comfortable flight. One minor irritant: for some reason this aircraft was not fitted with WiFi. We got into Mumbai at 8 am, a civilized time to arrive."
A320,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Keflavik  to London,July 2023,3.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3,yes,,4.0,"✅ Trip Verified | Keflavík, Iceland to London Heathrow on an A320 in Business Class. The journey got off on an unpleasant note - the Business Class line at Keflavík was so long that it looked like an Economy Class check-in. It took over 30 mins to get through. There was no lounge access offered. The boarding process was well handled. British Airways Business Class seats for the Club Europe product are terrible - exactly the same as Economy with the middle seat left vacant. You don't even get extra pitch. What made the overall product tolerable were the good onboard service and the inflight WiFi. Also the fact that the flight leaves at a convenient mid-morning time of 10:40 am."
,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Gibraltar to London Heathrow,May 2023,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified | Terrible Experience with British Airways. I booked a flight with BA to travel from Gibraltar to London Heathrow on May 10, 2023. My flight was scheduled to leave at 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon. I had originally planned on leaving my luggage at Heathrow upon arrival and travelling to visit and overnight at my cousin's place. En route to GIB airport a few hours prior to departure, I checked my flight details and found out that my flight had been cancelled. I had a connecting flight booked with Westjet from London Heathrow to Vancouver the following day and I had to make that flight, so it was imperative that I got to London. I checked the BA website and couldn't find any other flights with them that would work, so unfortunately I made the mistake of requesting a refund. I managed to find a flight out of Malaga that got me into London just after 10:00 p.m. so I booked that and then called British Airways as I wanted to discuss compensation. That's when they advised me that because I had requested a refund (they used the phrase ""abandoned"" travel with them), they were not prepared to do anything for me. Apparently, I should have called them first, and then they would have made the arrangements. Of course they don't explain that on their website - they just ask if you want a refund and then proceed. And even when I plead my case with the agent at Malaga airport and then followed up with Customer Relations several times via email, they flat out refused to budge. I had used a travel voucher to cover the cost of my flight and had used Avios to cover the cost of my checked baggage, so in other words no out of pocket costs for the trip. Once this incident happened, I ended up spending 660 euros in airfare and checked baggage charges to get to London from Malaga (i.e., different airport than the one I had originally booked from). And because the luggage storage facility at Heathrow had closed by the time I eventually arrived, I ended up booking a night at a hotel since I couldn't travel by train to my cousin's place any longer (3 bags in tow) and I didn't want to put him out and have him drive to the airport to pick me up. This cost me another £125 in room and meal costs. All BA ended up doing to compensate me was to give me 5,000 free Avios - a mere pittance compared to my out of pocket expenses. Despite trying to explain to them why I requested the refund instead of calling them first, they wouldn't budge. Very easy for them to say what I should have done since they work there and know the rules and they weren't the ones scrambling to find alternative travel arrangements within a few hours. I pointed out that on their website they should simply instruct customers to call them when this situation happens, and that way they would never encounter this problem. My feeling is that they put the refund option out there in the hope that customers will make the mistake I did so they can then wash their hands of the situation and ultimately save money. I've been an Executive Club member for years and they simply didn't care. They said there was nothing they could do. I'm sure if one of the BA executive's friends or family members had gone through this, staff there would have been given the instruction to make things right. I used to be a fan of BA but they have really gone downhill in my opinion. Once I used up my remaining Avios and travel credit, I will cancel my Executive Club membership and never fly with them again."
A321,Family Leisure,Business Class,Madrid to London,July 2023,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,,,✅ Trip Verified | An airline that lives in their past glory and heading a future of crisis is British Airways. I am not joking we are a family of 7 all in Business Class heading for a Norwegian and Arctic Cruise and they lost 10 of our bags! They will never see me on any of their flights ever a disaster of an airline
,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Rhodes to Gatwick,July 2023,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2,no,1.0,1.0,"✅ Trip Verified |  Check-in Desk rude and dismissive. Flight late but seems the new norm. One world emerald, club world check-in. Staff uncommunicative, did not know what baggage allowance entitled to, once raised (politely) became argumentative and accusatory."
,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Barcelona to London,July 2023,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1.0,1.0,"✅ Trip Verified | I chose British Airways especially because I was going to travel with my niece and nephew, and wanted everything to work well. What a disaster! First, it took me two hours to do the check-in online due to a technical problem. I also had to spend more than 20 minutes in a call to a UK number from my Spanish cell phone because that’s the only service they provide on weekends. Then, at the airport, when there was the boarding time, we had to wait with the rest of the people for almost two hours standing on the line without knowing what was going on. They just told us to wait. Finally we could access the plane. After 40 minutes inside, they told us to leave the plane again and told us the flight had been cancelled. We had to take our luggage and queue again for a couple of hours. Then, do the check in again and wait for another flight to take off, which was again delayed! We spent almost 12 hours at the airport. No information was provided, no solutions were offered. We had to seat in the last raw (when I had paid to seat on the first half of the plane). No money was refunded no apologizes or compensation was given. I also had pre-purchased food and they couldn’t provide the service. All in all, terrible. Never again!"
,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Inverness to Los Angeles via London,November 2022,,,,,1,no,,,"Not Verified | I booked Premium Economy from INV to LAX (via LHR). They notified me of a cancelled flight on my return journey and rebooked me on a flight that my connecting flight arrived too late for! Then they cancelled a flight on my journey to LAX! They then cancelled the rebooked flight on the return journey and rebooking me back on the first flight that they had rebooked me on - the flight that I have no chance of making as my return flight arrives too late into LHR. They re-routed me from LAX to JFK to LHR - which I would have accepted - but they booked the journey in Economy (LAX to JFK) which my husband (6'4"" with a knee injury) - cannot do and now they won't change it - even though they have a direct flight from LAX to LHR with Premium Economy and unacceptable flight allows us 54 mins to transfer flights at JFK - and my husband won't be able to walk slowly, let alone quickly, after enduring the 6-hour flight from LAX to LHR. I have chatted only to have my calls disconnected and I also have online chat which proves I did not accept this re-routed flight to JFK but they won't budge."
,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London City Airport to Frankfurt,July 2023,3.0,3.0,,1.0,1,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified | A simple story with an unfortunate outcome that really could happen to anyone. My partner and I recently started working after studying purchased two tickets to travel from London City Airport to Frankfurt. When we purchased the tickets, I mistakenly entered my name twice (e.g. Mr John Smith and Ms John Smith). Little did we know that our 1 simple mistake would cost us over 300 pounds. Upon arriving at the airport we were told there was no way to change the name (apparently they can only change 3 letters where there has been a typo?) and I had no other option to purchase the last remaining ticket if I wanted to board the flight - the price: almost seven times (!) higher than my original ticket. Zero empathy was shown. Zero alternative was offered. Trusting BA's staff and under the pretence that there was apparently no other way we could board the flight we bought this ticket. Immediately after I purchased the ticket I contacted BA's 'Commercial Change Booking Team' and informed them of our situation. The service representative apologised and told me they could have changed the name at the cost of a small fee. He offered to cancel my original ticket and issue me a partial refund then, advising me that I had a claim to the difference and I should contact Customer Support to do so. I told this person several times I wanted to claim the cost of the new ticket and even asked him explicitly if by accepting this offer, I would be denied from claiming the cost of the new ticket. He said no, I could claim the difference. Fair enough - we accepted this offer and lodged a ticket with Customer Support for the difference. Two days later, British Airways Customer Response informed us that we were unable to lodge a claim because we had 'voluntarily accepted the cancellation before the flight'. They've continued to send generic emails until this week, when they just stopped responding. So in short, British Airways misled and deceived my partner into accepting a lowball offer to waive our right to claim a refund. It keeps me up at night thinking how they can do this and get away with it so easily."
E190,Business,Economy Class,Amsterdam to London City ,July 2023,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight was delayed due to the inbound flight arriving late. There was no announcement to inform of the delay nor were the sceens updated. When ready to board we were requested to take our seats quickly to help reduce the delay, which people did. The pilot then announced he had received the documents for the wrong flight from ground staff, so we had to wait while they returned to get the right paperwork. After this was resolved, the pilot announced there would be a delay as there was only two push back tractors and we had to wait again. So after rushing to sit quickly, we sat the the aircraft at the gate for nearly one hour, which is longer than the flight takes ! Of course AMS is not BAs home base and it uses contracted staff here, but it should require a better level of service, It was embarrassing hearing the pilot apologise at every step of the way. It’ll be Eurostar for me next time."
A320,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Dalaman to Gatwick ,June 2023,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3,no,,,"Not Verified |  Fast and friendly check in (total contrast to Gatwick). The contract lounge is comfortable and spacious with a bar and pleasant staff but you have to pay for alcohol after the one free glass of wine. Food best avoided. On board, great crew and dinner was actually good quality and substantial apart from the ""chocolate and orange pot"" that seems to appear on every flight - have they bought up the global stock? The crew were always ready to top up drinks although white wine and beers were lukewarm. The crew explained that the carts are supposed to be chilled - from experience they rarely are. Is dry ice so expensive that BA can't afford it?"
Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to London Heathrow,June 2023,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3,no,3.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  I don't understand why British Airways is classified as a 4 star airline? The service is really mediocre. The food is untasty and insufficient for a long haul trip. Some members of the cabin crew are friendly but they are not attentive enough and create a very basic experience. This really is all about getting from point A to B without what it used to be an enjoyable trip making experience. The inflight entertainment is fairly good, but you do need to bring your own water not to get dehydrated, some snacks and ideally food and perhaps smile to yourself as otherwise you are faced with just a cold, personality less experience. "
A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Gatwick to Dalaman ,June 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,,,"Not Verified |  I'm sure that BA have gradually made their economy experience (BA Euroflyer out of Gatwick) so miserable that passengers are tempted to upgrade to the lacklustre and overpriced business class. Long wait at the biz checkin ( due to status ) and dealt with by a bored agent - OK third party, but still representing BA - who hardly spoke and avoided eye contact and was more focussed on her fingernails. Lounge was crowded and grubby but at least the staff there are pleasant and helpful On board the seats are cramped and uncomfortable and it took over two hours before crew appeared with food sales and the ""free water"" which on Gatwick services consists of a half full plastic cup rather than the luxury of a small bottle.. A fellow passenger mentioned the delay and the fact that they had no sandwiches for sale which prompted the flight attendant to say that the service was much better on Easyjet who do two service runs etc."
,Family Leisure,Business Class,London to Rhodes,July 2023,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  Customer Service does not exist. One world emerald, frequent long haul flyer (including BA) - never seen such poor customer service or “computer says no”. Official BA.com site said all morning and afternoon that flight from Gatwick, delayed 2 hours. Delayed leaving for airport -only for BA to change back to original time. Called BA customer service 1.5 hours prior from highway saying situation - told not to worry, would note and flight rebooked if issue but go to airport. Got to airport 40 mins prior told could not board and that staff did not work for BA so could not help. Back on phone, 3 hours in total to be told could be rebooked, then couldn’t be, round and round. Ultimately told to file complaint. Then found out flight left 2 hours delayed. Paid for extra hotels flights with more competent airlines and now told 38 days wait for complaints to be responded to - heavens help economy and non-status flyers if that’s what the front end of the plane gets!"
A320 A350,Family Leisure,Business Class,Newcastle to Las Vegas via Heathrow,June 2023,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4,yes,3.0,,"✅ Trip Verified | Another really great pair of flights, on time, no problems at all, champagne was ok and my meal choices were great, the new club suite is a good improvement over the previous seat, in flight entertainment could have been better, can’t wait to fly with BA again and enjoy another great experience."
A380,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Miami,June 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,,,"Not Verified |  Our A380 developed a fault taxiing to the runway - we returned to the gate only to then have the flight cancelled about 3 hours later due to a technical fault. All the while, BA staff were virtually non-existent, it was finally the captain who announced the flight was cancelled. BA provided an alternative the next day involving a connection but it was very much take this or else you were on your own. No arrangements or help made with overnight accommodation or transport,  Finally managed to get the legal minimum £520 compensation out of BA for the 26 hour delay they caused to my journey, and expenses were reimbursed too, but even this took four weeks. The fact that as a Business Class customer BA pays the minimum they can get away with says it all - they couldn't care less about customers, have no interest in loyalty and aren't bothered about your business. Given its our flights that pay BA's way, I'd suggest to anyone they take their hard earned cash to another airline who might at least care less about their customers. Not recommended. "
A320Neo,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Amman to London,July 2023,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3,no,1.0,3.0,Not Verified | Horrible airline. Does not care about their customers. Used to be decent but has now since really fell off. A flight time of 5 hours and 30 mins but no meal while the flight attendants were having their eggs and sausage in the back? Didn't even offer juices. I would stick with another airline.
Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Chennai to London ,July 2023,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1,no,1.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  My family and I have flown mostly on British Airways for the last 30 years. I am a priority passenger and fly often enough to recognise cabin crew and know some by name. They used to be a really good airline to fly with. Things have really deteriorated with their face to face customer care since the pandemic. The aircraft look worn. For example, on my flight back my audiovisual equipment did not work and had to be reset twice, finally working in the last hour before we landed. The second time around, I think the reset was done for the whole aircraft. The touch screen function on my screen did not work. The USB charger ports on my seat did not work. The staff were pleasant enough, but their service oozed mediocrity.  There did not seem to be much pride in what they were doing. The food has been the worst part on our BA flights since the pandemic. They gave us a menu, asked what we’d like, did a check and then told us that it was not available as they had run out and would we like to choose something else. They then told us that we’d get first choice at the second service which they couldn’t deliver on. Finally after choosing and getting whatever it is that we did, the food was tasteless. We take part in post flight surveys regularly and have stated all of this, to no avail. As a family of 3, we fly British Airways medium to long haul regularly, possibly 4-6 times a year each. For us, the good things about flying BA are that we are priority customers, usually have a direct flight to our destinations and get good service on the ground, when checking in and in the lounges when we use them."
A321neo,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Istanbul to London,July 2023,2.0,2.0,,1.0,1,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  This has been by far the worst service I have had on a plane. It's very obvious that if you are flying economy and not a frequent traveler of British Airways, they care very little about you. We had to wait an hour for them to even open the check-in. Once they did, they had 5 lines and only one that serviced economy. Even though the line for economy was three times the length of the premium classes. Then they told economy passengers that all bags had to be check and no carryon due to a full flight and no room in the overhead compartments. Once we arrived at the gate, there were not enough seats to fit everyone and you couldn't leave the boarding area. I will never fly this airline again! "
,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Edinburgh,November 2022,2.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,2,no,3.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  In Nov 2022 I booked and paid for a return journey to New Zealand. On my return journey my final flight was from London to Edinburgh. On trying to check in I was told my ticket ‘did not exist’. I showed evidence of my flight being booked and paid for but was denied a ticket. My only option was to buy a ticket for a later flight which cost £265.07. Since Nov 22, ie, 8 months ago, I have communicated multiple times with BA in an attempt to have my money returned. They have admitted responsibility for their error which cost me £265. I finally received word from them that they have decided to refund me the sum of £32.14. I have asked for an explanation but have received none, only a polite e mail informing me that the decision was checked and was correct. I do not intend to let this matter go. A company worth billions of pounds will not return an honest refund. PS, they also lost my luggage and did nothing to help me retrieve it. I tracked it down myself a week later to Edinburgh airport and picked it up myself."
Boeing 777 -200,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Kingston to London,June 2023,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3,no,3.0,,Not Verified | BA is not treating its premium economy passengers with respect. You pay for a premium economy service and are then compelled to use the economy toilets at the back of the plane. This is short-changing passengers. 
Boeing 777-200,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Cape Town,June 2023,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2,no,3.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  24 hours before our departure on BA059 to Cape Town from Heathrow on Thursday 29th June, we did an online check-in. Seats had already been allocated for my wife and I - 41 E and F - which are the middle two seats of the central block of four. These were totally unsuitable for us as we are in our late 70's and getting in and out of seats to stretch our legs or go the the toilet would mean climbing over a person on the aisle. But there were no other seats available. We got to Heathrow about 6 hours before departure and tried to change seats at check-in, to no avail, although the lady was very sympathetic and tried her utmost. She did offer us an upgrade to Premium Economy but at 450GBP each it was beyond our affordability. She said we should try again at the departure gate but that also failed. We spoke to a member of the flight crew who was totally unsympathetic. The economy seats are so tiny that I was jammed shoulder to shoulder between by wife and a stranger, with knees touching the seat pocket in front. For 12 hours we suffered. When we did manage to get out of our seat due to the kindness of the young lady next to me on the aisle, it was a mission trying to clamber past the reclined backrest in front of me. BA Economy is absolutely awful. The evening meal was near-inedible - both choices were spicy foods which are not very suitable when flying, especially for an older person. The breakfast Spanish Omelette was, however, not bad at all. The previous day we had flown economy from Malta to Heathrow on Malta Airlines and that 3 hour trip was a pleasure. The seats are wide and there is ample legroom. If they can do it, then why not British Airways."
,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Ibiza,July 2023,,,,1.0,1,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  We arrived at Heathrow at 0600 to find our flight to Ibiza was cancelled by BA with no explanation. As if that wasn’t galling enough, the customer service from BA at the airport was non-existent! There was no explanation, no apology and no assistance in finding an alternative flight. We’ve managed to find another flight from Stansted but that isn’t until much later today, thus wasting a chunk of our short trip. I simply don’t understand why BA don’t proactively contact their customers to notify them of a cancellation, and work with them to resolve the problem. Shocking customer service!"
A380,Business,Business Class,Washington to London,June 2023,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,no,3.0,,✅ Trip Verified |  Original flight was cancelled with no explanation. There was no representative to help in rebooking We had to call customer service (long distance call) The line kept dropping Had to do 40 + calls to find new booking only to discover the only way I could fly the next day was by paying business class. No help with hotel for the night stay.
A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Naples,June 2023,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2,no,,,"Not Verified |  Airport check in was functionary with little warmth but some efficiency. Flight was delayed with no communication given. Boarding was chaotic and no management of the process by ground staff. Seats on board are tight and you really feel like they have crammed in every seat possible. There is next to no recline. However I was thankful that there was no recline. If the person in front had even the slightest recline they would be in my face owing to how tight the seats were spaced on this A321 aircraft. No amenities on this flight except for a toilet that was clean but small. No IFE, no food and beverage unless you pay extra but the staff were friendly. Luggage arrived at the carousel within a very short amount of time."

,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dubai to Keflavik via London,May 2023,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  My flight on on 12 May 2023 got delayed an hour and 25 minutes which resulted in the cancellation of our connection flight on 12 May 2023 as the arrival of the first flight was only 15 before the departure of the second connecting flight. We contacted the BA call center multiple times to make changes to the flight in order to still arrive on the 12th of May to KEF airport through different flights. The team tried to find a solution but none made sense, not even on the next day the 13th of May 2023. We have made full booking of accommodation, car rental, activities etc for the vacation in Iceland. The cancellation of of these booking is not refundable. The call center suggested that we cancel the flight for a full refund, then claim compensation for the delay and difference in airfare cost and other non refundable bookings due to the delay and cancellation of our flight. British Airways responded to the claim after a month with no compensation at all, even though we paid additional $600 on new bookings and additional charges. The refund of the cancelled flight took more than a month with multiple calla to follow up almost every week. I was promised to get refund on the first call but later I found out it was not processed properly. Every-time I call the agent ask questions about why flight was canceled etc which is annoying when my understanding everything was under process for payment. After multiple calls I was refunded partially and not the full amount which is even bizarre from a company of this level. I had to make more calls to get the remaining balance refunded. The whole experience was terrible."
A321Neo,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cairo to London,June 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,no,1.0,1.0,"Not Verified |  Cairo is a 5 hour flight and BA considers it to be short haul, so everyone is crammed in with knees pressed up against the seat in front and nothing in the way of inflight entertainment. Not even a magazine - which is now available by WiFi that you have to pay for. You have to pay for your seat choice, checked in baggage, food & drink, WiFi. Not that I have anything against that - I'm used to that on budget airlines - but this is for a premium price ticket. I would have preferred to fly on easyJet where the initial ticket would have been less, and the extras would have been half the price. The BA app and website makes it really difficult to understand the extras and we ended up with baggage on the wrong ticket so had to pay extra. And don't get me started on their customer service helpline. On board the staff are ok but on the long Cairo-London route they spend most of their time on a break where they use the back row or two and talk loudly without any consideration for the passengers. And for the flyers who don't want the hassle of charges, minimal cabin service, and budget seats, then they could easily provide a 'premium economy' option  and really make a difference for the experience. Heathrow Terminal 5 compounds the poor experience, especially for arrivals. It is also poorly served by transport links - especially for those of us who live near Gatwick which is being abandoned by BA. I have been a frequent flyer for many years - and was even a BA Gold Card holder at one point - so I know about the potential experience. I used be able to make the choice - do I fly budget, or do I fly more comfortably for more? Now it's a case of flying budget, or flying budget for double the price with BA. "
,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Madrid,May 2023,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  After travelling London to Madrid with British Airways, then with Iberia from Madrid to Lima and LATAM to Cuzco, my luggage arrived 7 days after me. When attempting to collect my luggage, mine was the only one not to arrive. I sought help and was informed to make a claim online. When my bag finally arrived 7 days later, the lock had been forced open and everything inside the case searched. Someone emptied my 1st aid kit and toiletries and threw my clothing about, I felt violated. I have been treated appallingly from start to finish. For a month, I have been back and forth to British Airways, yet they stated it is not their fault. "

My Luggage arrived at LHR as planned on Saturday 6/24. However, upon arrival due to the luggage being mis-tagged and having the incorrect name on my luggage, it was never sent to Cairo. Its sitting in Terminal 3 in LHR (I have an air tag on my luggage) and British Airways is saying there is nothing they can do about it. I have filed 3 claims, made 13 phone calls, have been hung up on 3x and as simple as it is to solve this problem the workers at BA refuse to solve the problem. "

They gave me no updates, their website sucks, and it was nearly impossible to get someone on the phone. They finally delivered my luggage to my hotel after i had left to go back to the US, 5 days after I told them to ship it back to the US. Now, I’ve been calling everyday begging them to get my bag back to me. They appease me on the phone, tell me they’re fixing it, but nothing changes. The hotel can’t get in touch with them and they haven’t even tried to pick to bag back up. Several times, when I called I got a message saying they were not answering due to too many complaints and calls and to “call back later”. "
,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Amman,March 2023,,,,,1,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  We booked on the BA website, round trip flights from Seattle to Amman with a stop in London, in Business Class. Our first flight was delayed and then diverted to NYC, and enroute my husband experienced a medical emergency. When we landed in NYC we were taken to a hospital and I stayed in constant contact with the airline agent who had arranged for the ambulance transfer. The same evening we flew back home, confirming cancellation of all remaining flights with the agent at the airport. For the next several weeks, we spoke many times with BA Customer Service, trying to obtain some kind of refund — we were met with contradictory explanations, excuses and an absence of meaningful customer service. We discovered we had been marked as “no-shows” for our flight to Amman and that our return flight was still active. We were unable to cancel the return on the website, despite booking on the website. Our phone calls were never returned, we spent a minimum of 40-60 minutes on hold for every phone call we made, our emails received only canned replies without answers or explanations, we were told it was “not possible” to receive a copy of the ticketing rules and regulations nor to speak with a supervisor, and after several weeks of this abysmal customer service I filed a complaint with the FAA. In response to my complaint I received an email from BA Customer Service explaining that they had reviewed my many requests for a “full refund” but that could not be accommodated due to the ticketing rules. They would issue flight credits - except for the portion for which we no-showed. They did not state how many credits. We never once asked for a full refund - we asked to read the rules and to receive a partial refund. We will not use the credits - we were fully refunded by our travel insurance."

Embraer 190,Family Leisure,Business Class,London City to Ibiza,June 2023,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3,yes,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  This is a two-for-one review covering economy and business class on the BA flight from London City to Ibiza. Economy was excellent. A very light lunch (small cheese-and-pastrami sandwich, chocolate brownie) followed by a pretty much free-flowing drinks trolley. The flight was full but the crew worked hard and did a very good job. This is a flight I would recommend. Except, don't fall for the last minute offer for an upgrade to business for £100+ in each direction, as I did. (I flew economy out and business back, while my brother flew business, then economy.) The business seats are identical to economy, with no seats blocked, so you are squished in four abreast. The meals are almost identical, with minor tweaks such as a yoghurt for your £100. The only real plus is Champagne. But on my flight, there was none because of ""supply issues"". The cabin attendant (I think his name was Tom) must be one of the best in the business. I didn't eat, so I paid £100 for nothing. Oh well. So great flight but stick with economy."

Boeing 737,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Kalamata,June 2023,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3,yes,,,"✅ Trip Verified | Travelled to Heathrow to Kalamata and return journey 11 days later. World Traveller (aka Economy) Class. Both flights departed on time. Return flight landed early - BUT - we then had a 1 1/4 hour wait for the baggage to be offloaded which rather ruined the journey home as we then caught a motorway closure. Flights OK - FA's (particularly on return flight) pleasant enough. But, as usual, Economy class seating was truly dreadful - no legroom at all. No better in Club class either - only the middle seat left free. Marked down because of this. Can only recommend if you are not tall."
,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Funchal ,June 2023,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,,,Not Verified |  This flight failed at every level. We were delayed and arrived at our destination late so that our prepaid car transfer phoned to advise us that he could only wait another 10 minutes for us but this was a BA holiday. We pre ordered food for our flight and this was never loaded onto our flight and to finally compound British Airways complete and utter uselessness our luggage was still in Heathrow. As there is no flight tomorrow the earliest this luggage could possible arrive is very late on Wednesday evening. Having only the clothes that you flew in and reading you can only claim for toiletries and underwear seems to be the antithesis of a happy holiday. I might have expected a complimentary scone in lieu of no food but no we were told that we could purchase from the trolley what they had available. I would like to make it clear that we are British airways bronze level holders which as we have been long retired shows how we have used this airline historically.
,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Marseille to Seattle via London Heathrow,June 2023,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,no,4.0,2.0,"Not Verified |  Beware of British Airways and their marketing to make you believe that they are full of class and level above the rest. They won't treat you that way when you get bumped from a flight and it is their responsibility to compensate you for their mistakes. We recently had a trip home planned from MRS to SEA. A mechanical issue meant that we departed late from MRS to LHR where we needed to make a connecting flight. We landed with plenty of time to make it to our next gate, but a series of issues and choices by British Airways kept us from boarding our next plane. The crew did not let off passengers with connecting flights first nor did they hold the next flight for a mere 5-10 minutes for passengers to make connections on their airlines. Plus, we discovered that we had actually been bumped off our next flight before we even landed. We were pushed to Virgin Atlantic to figure out how to get us home. It extended our travel day by 8 hours! We were traveling with children as well. No offers of compensation or upgrades were made. And now BA is refusing to provide us any financial compensation. We paid for a trip home with only one connection and instead had two connections, multiple airlines to deal with, security through an extra airport with kids for a midnight flight we were never planning on. That is not what we paid for but BA refuses to make it right. So beware potential travelers!"
,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Cairo to London ,June 2023,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1,no,1.0,2.0,✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from Cairo to Heathrow on what they call euro club class which is a cramped coach seat with the middle empty seat. Horrible service. I get to Heathrow airport 40 minutes late so I had to run around looking for my connecting flight. Finally jumping through escalators and train to another building where is my gate. Given a seat that is different than what I paid extra for ?! It’s a shame for such well known airline.

I waited 3 weeks for a ticket change. Call center workers are giving you false information just so they would make you hang up. They told me I was supposed to get an email from them with the flight changes, but never got. They don't have a live chat just like American Airlines do, they don't have a online form to submit your questions, they don t have a working international number. Total garbage."

Because of an accident by the airport, we arrived at the airport only 1 hour before the flight. The kiosk was unable to read one of our passports and we had to go to check-in. The lady at the check-in checked the passport and gave us a boarding pass. Because we had no extra time, we headed straight to security and didn’t realize the lady gave us a duplicated boarding pass (not of the passport holder). We got stuck in security because of that, couldn’t figure out what was wrong. We only didn’t miss the flight because we ran through the airport with a 70 year old and a 9 year old included in the party. The staff at the gate was very cordial and helpful once we arrived there."
,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dublin to London City,June 2023,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,,,✅ Trip Verified | Flight at 8.40am from DUB to LCY cancelled 1155pm night before. No text message. No phone. Waiting at bus stop and randomly checked email to see alternate flight option. Hang on? What’s this! It was dark at 5am. It was hard to see mobile phone screen. I’m still jet lagged. Only option was to LHR at 9.20am. Tried calling. No one there. So accepted it. But I didn’t see the day change! It was the next day! I didn’t want the flight (as was staying at Docklands hence choosing LCY but thought I better take it as it’s leaving an hour after the original flight. Nope. I better call to say hey sorry I screwed up. Your flight is not going to work for me. I don’t have any more accommodation in Dublin and I don’t want to waste one night in London. Called. The most surly customer service (can you even be called that when you treat people like this) answered. She kept calling me James (not my name). She was brutal. You accepted it. I can’t do anything. She basically made me feel like a moron because in a moment of confusion I accepted the first available flight from the stupid supercomputer. She kept telling me about the algorithm and this was the flight that was chosen. But if you had called us we could have put you onto a Aer Lingus flight! Why didn’t you call? You are at fault. Just so callous and uncaring. She wanted to charge me 600 pounds in new flights and change fees. I said nope and booked a flight today with Ryanair. Plus I need to find my way from Gatwick to Docklands. More money from me because of BA’s utter contempt for their passengers. I’ve been flying Qantas for 25 years and they can do some funky stuff. But never this level of cruelty because of one simple error. Never again. How do people accept such utter contempt and ineptitude? Welcome to the U.K.! Just wow.
,Business,Business Class,Tokyo to Manchester via Heathrow,June 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1.0,1.0,✅ Trip Verified |  Terrible. I have traveled twice with them this year via business class and they have been significantly delayed or cancellations with connecting flights. The customer service or complete lack of it is appalling and has forced me to change credit cards as I no longer intend to use BA for any further flights. Terrible uncomfy old planes and miserable staff.

It's a long time since I have flown long-haul, the cramped conditions were awful. The rows were so close together when the person in front reclined their seat my TV was so close I couldn't focus on it.  BA seem to want to make economy so uncomfortable to encourage customers to upgrade, this has not worked on me, I will avoid flying BA in future. My onward flight was with LATAM, same 787 aircraft but more room between rows, far more comfortable. On the return flight from Santiago the lights were turned down at 8pm, I feel the cabin crew do this to avoid providing a service, they just disappear behind the curtains."
,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Nice via London,June 2023,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,2,no,5.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked our first out of country trip to take my husband on a surprise trip to Monaco. I gave us over 3 hours for our connecting flight to and from home through Heathrow. Our flight left Seattle an hour late causing us to miss our connecting flight. We were rescheduled before we even landed. They booked us on a flight 7 hours later and offered no food tickets or any other type of reimbursement. Additionally we sat in their customer service line for an hour and a half to see if they could rebook us on an earlier flight, to watch them continually assist other customers that walked up outside of the queue (no earlier flights were available). When we arrived in Nice, France the airport was closed, including the rental car desk. We were not offered any assistance from the airline on a room or other accommodation for the night. We found a cab, which cost us 85 euros one one to get to our hotel. We thought there is no way something like this could happen on the way home….we were wrong. Our flight from Nice to Heathrow was 30 minutes late, with a 2.5 hour layover you would think we should still make our flight, unfortunately long security lines caused over 1.5 hr further delay. When arriving BA closed the doors and said they could not hold the plane any longer despite arriving 15mins before departure. After running through the Heathrow airport and going through security again. They sent us back to the customer service queue, where the first statement was we can’t get you out until tomorrow. After begging they found us a flight on another airline. At that time we were told our bags were transferred to our flight with Delta. We were given 8 pounds each for snacks at the airport for our now additional 5 hour delay. In total for our trip there and home we spent 13 hours at Heathrow airport which our original total layover of 6 hours, and we were offered 8 pound each. Unfortunately the drama continues. The two bags that they said made the Delta flight, shockingly did not. We were told that we had the file the claim with Delta, since the last part of our flight was with them. We have now been home for 5 days and each airline is pointing the finger at the other. As I said to both of them today. I don’t care who’ has my bags figure it out and send me my luggage I don't want your $500 reimbursement per bag, as that doesn’t come close to the memories and stuff that I have in there. I will never fly British Airways again, and Delta’s baggage people are not doing great either."
,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Sydney via Singapore to London Heathrow ,March 2023,4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,1,no,,,✅ Trip Verified | My husband and I booked seats within our premium economy booking. On both outward journey BA015 on 12 February and return on 11 March we were last OR almost last to be served food. Each time they had run out of our choices. On one occasion I did not eat as only available option was curry which disagrees with me. On all flights there appeared to be an undue focus on curry/spicy food. All in all very disappointing and left us with a very poor opinion of British Airways.

BA lost my golf bag which caused me to purchase golf shoes, club rentals, tees, balls. I had tee times at two courses in St. Andrews that took months to make. The promised my bag returned in 24 hours and they would reimburse occurred expenses. I contacted BA and they state they would only reimburse toiletries. Then the return flight home was randomly canceled by BA without notifying me or without notice two weeks before the scheduled flight. I contacted the corporate travel team, they informed me BA, canceled my return reservation. They rebooked me on the same flight. BA customer service was horrendous and make false promises. I will never use this airlines again. Beware of British Airways. They also randomly canceled my girlfriend and her fathers flight and they are both gold members."
,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Athens to Durban via London Heathrow,April 2023,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4,no,3.0,,"✅ Trip Verified | I went through three flights to reach my destination. All of my BA flights without exception were delayed, both on my way to my destination and back from my destination which is understandable to an extent. What's not understandable is that they weren't prepared for one of the flights and delayed by almost an hour so I ended up missing a flight and for that they rebooked me 24h ahead providing only accommodation which they messed up as well and after 30 hours of traveling I had to wait and hope that the hotel would find an extra room since BA didn't communicate properly with them. I gave BA a chance to correct their mistake by contacting them after the flights but all they did was answer once with a lot of serious complaints that were involved with their flights and all they did was tell me to contact their partners that I had the last flight with, which went smoothly and they had nothing to do with the previously addressed complaints. I contacted them and gave them over a week asking why they didn't address any of my complaints that their partner could have nothing to do with and they just ghosted me. 2/10 for the kind personnel that's holding this airline together though."

The welcome aboard was warm and that continued throughout the flight. The crew were attentive, friendly and very professional. On board food for dinner and breakfast was good and there was a well chosen selection of wines. In flight entertainment offered a great selection of films and audio. The seat/flat bed was very comfortable - British Airways have done an excellent job in the design and comfort of the suites on board the A350. I liked the sleek, minimalist design. This flight showed that BA can be among the world’s best airlines."

We were left with 45 minutes only to catch our connecting flight to Barcelona, we needed to run and take the train to different terminal to catch our next connecting flight. When we arrived at Barcelona airport, we discovered that our check in luggage was still in London. Very painful trip (disrupted our vacation).

The check-in process was terrible and slow. There were over 30 people in the regular check in line and they had two agents working it. They had one agent working the first class line. It should not take that long to check people in especially when people should have checked in online ahead of time. Our group checked in online and almost missed our plane because of the slow counter service. We had to run to the gate and we did make it, but they were terrible!"
,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Venice,May 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1.0,1.0,"Not Verified |  My itinerary was supposed to be Las Vegas-Chicago-London-Venice. When I landed in London Heathrow, I was stuck on the aircraft for 2 hours with no explanation as to why and because of such a delay I missed my connecting flight to Venice. Getting off the plane was when the real nightmare took place. Our flight had over 300 people aboard meaning many were in a rush to get to their flights or had already missed their flight. They put us into two lines, one of them being for people who missed their flight. I waited approximately 10 minutes just to come up to a clerk who told me ""Since I missed my flight I would have to go to the connecting flight BA service desks for further assistance."" If I were to have known that was the only information I would receive I would have skipped being in that line altogether. When I went to the service desk where there were more than 60+ people standing in line, I waited 30+ minutes until a clerk came by passing everyone a pamphlet telling people to create an account online and to book our flights through the BA site since their systems were down and couldn't rebook anyone. It was a hassle doing anything through he BA site so I ended up calling the helpline. After waiting to be connected to a BA rep. I spoke with a woman who said I would have to call Iberia Airlines for a rebook, I called Iberia and they said since I booked through Expedia I would have to call them. Expedia then said I would have to call BA for the rebook so when I called BA again, the rep. said the only flight he could get me booked for was for the following Monday, mind you I was travelling since the 25th which was a Friday. All the hotels in the vicinity of the airport were booked, I was trying to figure out where my checked baggage went (I still don't have it), most of the customer service I got from BA reps was horrible service as if they could care less for the predicament their company caused me. They acted like I was inconveniencing them with ""my issues"". I also had to sleep in the airport waiting for my flight the next morning because hotels were booked. Overall my experience with British Airlines has been the worst airline experience I've ever had to deal with. I will never book with this company again. I would rather pay more money for a ticket in a different airline than buy through this company again."

,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Dallas to Madrid via London,May 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1.0,1.0,"Not Verified | Top Ten REASONS to not use British Airways To all: Be Aware and be on Notice- Travel at your own risk I have travelled for years on many different airlines, and I have to say that British Airways ranks as one of the top two most horrible airlines to fly. Don’t waste your time or money. Customer service is non-existent. Please be on notice that if you purchase a ticket from them and once, they have your money, you can kiss any customer service and or help resolving your issue goodbye. We used them to travel to Europe and it was the worst experience I have had with an airline in years. When you work hard and save your money to travel, you expect a good experience. Welp not with this company. Who I am sure, makes millions on customers per year. I understand that sometimes things happen, but this started right after we booked our flight AND THE BAD EXPERIENCE DID NOT END UNTIL WE SET FOOT BACK TO OUR HOMETOWN. Please take note: #1 - The customer service number is buried on the internet and not listed on their website. I had to google it and still got the run around when someone finally answered. Trust me, the number is a secret. #2 – When you FINALLY find a customer service number, there is a long wait and when or if someone answers, they will not resolve your issues. Instead, they pass the buck to whatever airlines that they sold your ticket to. NO ONE TAKES OWNERSHIP #4- What airlines operates 365 days a year and around the clock but doesn’t have customer service reps to help you, the customer? BRITISH AIRWAYS that’s who. #5 - They will cancel your flight without notice and not notify you, AT ALL. NO EMAIL, NO TEXT. #6- If you are not the primary on your ticket you will get no notifications or even if you are the primary, you may or may not get notifications. #7 - If you pay for seats and you pick them, it doesn’t matter, they will cancel your seats and not refund your money and then play stupid. #8 - The flight may be cheaper, but it is not once you are done paying for seats. #9- They will route to another partner airline and not notify you #10 – If you have a connecting flight, they will cancel one leg and not the other and NOT NOTIFY YOU. I will never use them again. And if this review helps one person that heeds my advice, then my job is done."

Our return flight to Valencia was booked for the afternoon and our long haul flight arrived early at Heathrow. This was with another airline and was not a connecting flight.

We had our flights changed with no cost and were checked in within five minutes. That is indeed customer service. Thank you.

Hard, thin, uncomfortable seats, poor legroom and the cabin was simply tatty - I remain shocked that BA allow this, and it's time for BA's CEO and management focused on standards rather than bean counting. Finnair cabin staff were fundamentally courteous, but they provide a very trimmed down, budget airline type service, as the whole trip turned out to be - and yet this business class ticket was one of the more expensive on recent trips. I thought post Covid that BA were better for a few months, but with the many cost cuts they are making, they fall well below all other European full service Airlines. "
A319,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Nice,May 2023,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1,no,,1.0,"Not Verified | Paid a quick visit to Nice yesterday from Heathrow. Decided to go Business class since my last short haul flight in Economy was a real crush and rather unpleasant. I paid over £300 for a business class round trip. I went into the to BA lounge in Terminal 5 which was very crowded. Being 6.30 in the morning I decided against having a drink and stuck to the breakfast offering. The cooked options did not look that appealing but the fresh fruit selection was very enjoyable. We subsequently discovered a much nicer BA lounge closer to the gate, B36, and waited there for 40 mins. Boarding was efficient and we got ourselves seated in 2A and 2C, seat 2B was blocked out, which acted as an additional table. There did not seem to be any difference in the width of the seat from the cramped seating in Economy but there may have been an additional inch of leg room. I think that BA are trying to outdo EasyJet in terms on no frills. It would not cost BA that much to supply Business class passengers with a complimentary newspaper to read during the flight. The inflight magazine is no longer available. There are no screens so there was zero in terms of in flight entertainment. The inflight WiFi was flaky at best and non-existent at other times. I was glad it was only a two hour flight. I really do not think the fare that we paid was worth the money"
,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to San Francisco,September 2022,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2,no,4.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  Words fail to describe this last awful flight - baby across the aisle crying for most of the flight and although horrible to go without any rest for the long flight LHR/SFO, it's understandable for a baby to cry nonstop - but the crew yakking loudly in the galley even after a polite notification that their conversation could be heard in the cabin - that made the flight unbearable for any rest or sleep (always difficult anyway westbound). The food was so bad that most  turned down whatever the nasty offering was on the 2nd service. What happened to the really nice tea and scones? I've said this before after suffering through the BA concept of customer service (i.e. don't do anything to help the passenger if it involves any extra work) - this time i swear i mean it - never again on BA please! The lounge was so packed even a single traveler had a hard time finding a seat - poor BA is on the skids downhill."
,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Dallas,April 2023,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1,no,3.0,1.0,"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely terrible experience. The app would not let me check in online and repeatedly asked for COVID documents, but then did not accept them even when provided. I was trying to fly back to the USA, where I am a citizen and the app caused repeated errors. I went to British Airways Customer Service to check in and was told that my seat was already given away to another passenger, even though I was there in plenty of time. This was also during an industrial action at Heathrow, meaning the number of flights were limited. I was delayed over 24 hours in returning to the USA, all because of their terrible app and then bad customer service that gives away seats even when the paid passenger is already there at the airport."
,Business,Economy Class,London to Madrid,May 2023,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,,,✅ Trip Verified | BA overbook every flight to maximise their income with no regard for the customer. It means you cannot check in online or at the kiosk in the airport and have to queue even with no luggage. Makes easyJet and Ryanair look like customer champions. The server in Itsu in the BA terminal says she stopped flying BA years ago due to the service being bad all the time. Most customers she serves have a complaint Staff don't care as poor service and unhappy customers is a routine occurrence.

The flights were all on time, except Belfast from London which never is. The Staff were efficient. My issue is the App, I could not book seats to Tel Aviv though tried for a month as wanted to pay. So ended up in a middle seat even though a window seat was available on the flight. The seat was in front of the dividing barrier and was used as thoroughfare by the service team throughout the flight so I wasted my money on PE seat! You can get hold of BA customer service via the app either and they have just ignored all other communication so just won't use them again."
,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Los Angeles to London,May 2023,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1,no,5.0,2.0,"Not Verified | Only the second time flying BA as first time wasn’t positive. Could have made my connection in Heathrow if BA had been proactive. Instead, overnight at the Renaissance hotel compliments of BA. Adequate, but one wonders why a large part of this hotel is devoted to sleeping and feeding of hundreds of stranded passengers. If BA had offered one employee to help us get to our gate instead of waiting for the shuttle bus which was a half hour late arriving, we could have made our flight and saved BA the cost of rebooking, hotel, shuttle, food accommodations. Another bad show. Business class fare should offer more."
,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Atlanta to London,April 2023,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,2.0,1.0,"✅ Trip Verified | I wasn't going to bother reviewing this flight as I seem to be on a perpetual downer with BA but the airport experience convinced me otherwise. After having our flight class reduced from First to Business, then offered an alternative route on the outward leg in First to make up for the disappointment, they then reneged on this. As it was a special anniversary it sucked. Flying back we checked in online to our chosen window seats, at the gate we had to show our passports as we passport before boarding as we were hand luggage only. Trying to board we had our passports checked twice more and were issued new boarding cards for centre seats. Unbelievable! The flight itself was very quiet and only half the normal crew for this aircraft was unavailable. This meant no pre-departure drinks and a limited selection of food. The crew was great but what an earth is going on at BA, they have this unique knack to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory every time. I say this as the new club suites are great."
,Couple Leisure,Business Class,,May 2023,,,,,1,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked business class tickets for my fiancé and I. I had to reschedule my flight due to an unforeseen timing change, so I called to get have my flight refunded. The representative on the phone informed me he wasn't sure how much I would get, as the refund department needed to check, but estimated I would lose 10-20% of my booking to fees. I accepted. I never got a cancellation email, or any update, but instead received $35 total back. Less than 1% of my booking costs. Since then I have spent over 5 hours calling different departments before they blocked me. I've lost a tremendous amount of money with nothing to show."
Boeing 787-9,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Sydney to London via Singapore,May 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1.0,1.0,"✅ Trip Verified |  I will never travel with British Airways again. I spent over $10,000 on a business class seat to attend a funeral in the UK. First, the Boeing 787-9 cabin has 7 seats across the aisle so what you are getting in reality is premium economy. The seats are narrow and effectively are a business class seat cut in half. They have squeezed these seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to go to the toilet, which wakes up that passenger. The whole point about business class is that you pay to rest and have privacy and not have someone push over the top of you. Second, the food was disgusting. Third, the service terrible. Fourth, the toilet was tiny. Fifth, the inflight screen was fixed and too high so I could not see anything. Sixth, their baggage handling is also appalling meaning that my taxi was waiting for 2 hours and I had to pay more (no free airport transfers with British Airways). Seventh, the charging points did not work. The second leg to London was on a larger plane with 4 seats across the aisle. That was bearable because no hopping over people but the seat was very uncomfortable because it was not one piece. This means that you are sleeping on a metal bar (the seat) where there is a gap in the seat. To add insult to injury I now find that both flights back to Sydney are on the small plane. To book a seat before check in is $170. I paid it but note that there were only 4 seats left. This is why I got the worst seat in the house going out. This is the most appalling airline service I have ever encountered. There is no point paying for business class in British Airways. "

,Business,Economy Class,London to Barcelona,May 2023,,,,1.0,1,no,,,✅ Trip Verified |  Terrible. Avoid this airline. It’s now becoming regular practice to cancel flights. Had a cancellation from Switzerland that forced us to spend the whole night in a cheap hotel and had to fly out the next day and then had another cancellation to Spain. The airline only knows how to ask for expensive prices.
,Business,Economy Class,New York to London,April 2023,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,no,3.0,4.0,"✅ Trip Verified |  Despite being a gold member, the British Airways staff in Heathrow literally could not care in the slightest about the absolute turmoil and logistical damage or wider impact of their terrible service. All the staff members repeat the same mantra - “we are not obliged to provide even an update for the first 24 hours” as if that would make the situation better. There are no proactive updates, no empathy, no care but a lot of actual lies being told. You can tell that they have given up any care or thought for the passengers as actual individuals - they show this in every action and word they say. All of them are better suited to working away from other humans."
Boeing 787,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Singapore to London,April 2023,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1,no,5.0,1.0,"Not Verified | Regarding the aircraft and seat: The business class seats on this flight were pretty good. All were of the suite type, where every seat has its own booth with sliding door for extra privacy. The downside to this is that if you are travelling as a couple, its quite difficult to interact. There is ample storage and USB charging ports. The seat is pretty comfortable. As someone who finds it very difficult to sleep on flights, this was one of the only times I've been able to get a few minutes sleep here and there. The amenities provided are pretty average when compared to other airlines. The leather toiletry bag was quite nice though. No slippers, only a pair of socks. The restrooms on the flight are very small, and don't provide much in the way of toiletries compared to other airlines. No free Wi-Fi in Business Class is not acceptable. Another example of BA's penny pinching in recent years. Regarding the staff and customer service: Poor. Inattentive. Beyond meal times there was offer of water during the flight. I had to go and find an attendant and ask. There was also no offer of any snacks. Rude at times. My partner asked for a fork to be replaced as the one provided was quite clearly dirty. The attendant was incredibly rude in response. This left us shocked. Different customers seem to receive a different quality of service. A customer behind me was repeatedly greeted politely by name and asked how they were, whether they needed anything etc. whereas my partner and I were not afforded the same level of personal service. This is disappointing as we paid the same price for the tickets so expect the same level of service. The food was pretty bad. I had risotto while my partner had chicken. Both were extremely over cooked and the rice looked like porridge. The vegetables were discoloured and flavourless. The bread was nice though. The breakfast wasn't much better. Summary: BA has become the Ryanair of long haul. The customer service is way below what I would expect for a premium airline in a premium seat. You pay a premium price for a very average service. If there are other options available I would choose them over BA these days."
,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sweden to Los Angeles via London,January 2023,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1,no,2.0,,"Not Verified | I travelled with British Airways from Sweden to Los Angeles via London in December 2022. When I arrived at LAX one of my bags were missing. There was no information of the whereabouts of my bag and after searching for someone for about 30 minutes, I found the point of contact and she told me my bag was left behind. I gave her my details of where I would be staying and she told me that they would contact me. After a few days and still no contact I tried to call British Airways customer service. The woman at the airport didn’t give me a file reference number, so it was quite difficult to try and locate my bag, but they finally found the reference number and my bag and said it would be delivered in a couple of days. I told them that I had switched hotels and gave them the address for where I was staying and everything was fine. But then a couple of weeks went by and my bag was still nowhere to be seen and it was time for me to fly home. At the airport I tried to talk with the personnel there to try and locate my bag and they said that it was delivered to the first hotel I stayed at, even though I had given them an updated address. I asked them what I should to since I was flying home now. The guy at the counter told me that it wasn’t his problem and that I should figure it out myself. I questioned him about his response and he just walked away. A manager saw that and came up to me and apologized for his colleague and that they would send someone to fetch my bag and send it with either my flight or the next one. I came home and a couple of days later I received my bag. I made a complaint and claims on British Airways website since I had to buy clothes and toiletries during my vacation because I didn’t have my bag. In January they said that they would refund me for my claims, it is now April (almost May) and I have still not received the refund even after multiple email conversations. I don’t know what to do anymore about this situation since it appears that no one is willing to help me. I am appalled about how the situation is being handled and frankly disappointed at British Airways and the lack of customer service."

Who ever is planning the Asian Hindu Vegetarian meal is clueless as to what this meal includes. The snack was also lousy. It took us 2 hours just to go from T5 to T3 and clear security check. The place was chaotic. We get to our boarding gate and again a long line with 40 minutes wait for someone to check passport and boarding pass. Seats in Premium economy was ok, but when the passenger in front reclines, there is very little space for the window seat passenger to cross over. Overall not a good airline."

We were four including an infant and a toddler aged 4 years, despite being delayed and missed the connecting flight the ground staff were not at all helpful. We waited for an hour to get them to talk to us and at 12 am they told us they have not booked any hotel for us to stay that night and asked to go search for a hotel on your own, very nice of you British Airways. At least you guys should have given some consideration to the travelers who travel with children and booked some accommodation. We will NOT to travel on this airline again."

Despite a three hour delay and missing my connection in Hong Kong, this was a very pleasant flight. Seats are spacious and comfortable in Premium Economy in this layout, attitude of the cabin crew was excellent and food was good. They communicate well and rebooked my connection during the flight which brought peace of mind. A very pleasant experience in BA Premium Economy after a major disappointment in Club World earlier this year."

We paid extra to choose our seats. Since they cancelled they never honored the seat that we bought, they seated us in totally different seats. I asked the check in employee, she was very rude and told us that we have to understand that was a different flight. From London to LAX was worse, nobody in the airport help us. Employees from BA told us that we have to return next day for our flight we can rent a hotel or go terminal 3 and sleep there. Finally one employee help us and gives a voucher for hotel. It was a nightmare this airline. We missed one day work and BA didn’t return the money that we paid for our previous chosen seats."

,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Denver,March 2023,2.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,1,no,3.0,1.0,✅ Trip Verified |  Worst experience of my life trying to deal with the customer service for British Airways. So many issues with getting from one destination to the other. Had an absolutely horrible time trying to get answers or reach anyone who was capable of helping navigate uncertainties. I wrote them a formal complaint requesting some type of refund and received a generic “we are sorry” email with 5000 avios attached which is equivalent to maybe $50 on a $600+ flight. Needless to say these will go to waste as I refuse to fly with an untrustworthy incompetent unorganized airline that couldn’t even address one single issue expressed to them. It was equivalent to handing me a band aid after slapping me in the face. I will say the flight itself was smooth and the onboard staff was kind and attentive. The most frustrating thing is that the customer service is trained to give you the runaround so heavily to the point of exhaustion that you just give up trying and take the loss.
,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hong Kong to London,April 2023,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2,no,1.0,1.0,"✅ Trip Verified |  Due to code sharing with Cathay Pacific I was downgraded to BA on my return leg. I can’t describe how cheated I felt. I booked and paid for an airline with great entertainment, food and service, instead, I was forced to go hungry because they only had one choice of meal and it was inedible. To ensure the passengers didn’t get any funny ideas and assume that as the vegetarian option was unavailable they might be given a cracker or a small packet of nuts. The cabin crew announced in their uniquely aggressive and dismissive way “You won’t get anything else for 12 hours you know!” the entertainment is compiled mainly of B movies so I paid £11 for Wi-Fi so I could watch Netflix on my laptop. Unsurprisingly, the signal was so weak I couldn’t even send an email. To add insult to injury, the earbuds provided the cheapest and lowest quality I have ever seen. Since the last time I used this airline the crew are less rude and obnoxious and are now just impatient and unhelpful.  What I don’t understand is why it seems that British Airways look for these characteristics as desirable attributes for their crew. "
A320,Business,Business Class,Heathrow to Malaga,April 2023,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2,no,,1.0,"✅ Trip Verified |  LHR check in was quick at the First Wing and quickly through security. The First lounge was quiet for a change and a reasonably good breakfast buffet available. While BA have brought back their Highlife magazine in the lounge, it seems they used Covid to scrap all the other magazines they used to offer, as part of the endless BA cost cutting. The toilets in the lounge were as disgusting as ever, not cleaned frequently on this visit and they are about 20 years out of date (the public washrooms in T5 are better and cleaner). Boarding was the usual BA muddled mess, and two of the gate staff appeared to have no clue what they were doing. Endless announcements at the gate about being a full flight, requesting passengers to check in bags, only to get on a flight that was less than 40% full. Onboard a very good welcome from Captain and the flight left the gate only 5 mins late. Breakfast had 3 choices and was a fair standard. No hot towels or even packet towels offered in Club Europe any more, another part of the relentless BA cost cutting. I wouldn't mind but fares are proportionately a lot higher now than pre Covid. Cabin staff service was perfunctory at best, not a scrap of recognition for BA Gold or Oneworld Emerald members, clear proof that BA really don't care any more. Breakfast trays cleared 45 mins into the flight, and that was the sign for staff to stay in the front galley for the rest of the flight. Paid £4.99 for 1 hours wifi, and dropped connection for the next 40 mins. Sad to note that staff service on Ryanair is more pro active nowadays. Priority tagged suitcase came out nearly last at Malaga, this is standard for BA business class baggage handling. Do not waste your money on Club Europe, standards just keep dropping. "

I tried to call to customer service for 3 times in different days and time and I waited for more than 30 minutes on the phone! I ended hanging up. They are excusing themselves in the high volume of calls. I write an email an I am still waiting for 2 weeks!  Website is difficult to navigate. It is not easy really to have an invoice of proof of receipt or look for another service. They sent you online but you don't receive a PDF file. So if you need a proof of flight, you need to do screenshots. And, once the flight is flown, you have no access to that booking again to reprint any document or try to create a PDF. You need to contact with a customer service which I did it online, long waiting time, and had to wait more than a week to receive it. Expensive and poor, almost inexistent customer service and difficult to use their website. An airline that definitely wouldn't recommend. It is such a shame that in 2023 they are still in this position and sleeping when they have competitors around"

I booked a ticket from Expedia for a British Airways Operated flight from Madrid to Belfast with a changeover at London Heathrow. The whole itinerary was listed as BA although the Madrid to London flight was Iberia. On Jan 22nd, London was experiencing cold and fog. The Iberian flight sat on the tarmac for 2 hours in Madrid because of the London weather. Upon landing in Terminal 3, I had to take a bus to Terminal 5. The flight was the last flight to Belfast for the evening and it had already taken off. The BA desk was swamped with people as many people had to spend the night due to the weather. The British Airways staff said that we could go book any hotel up to 200 pounds and we would be reimbursed. I was barely able to find a room and had to take an expensive cab. However when trying to get the reimbursement, BA said it wasn't their problem and that it was Iberia's problem. Iberia said they do not reimburse due to the weather. When complaining to BA, they said they only market the flight as BA and that they refuse to reimburse. Absolutely disgusting behavior by the airline to not take any responsibility for a flight that they were using their name to sell it to people but don't want to take responsibility for it. Did they expect me to take the bus back to Terminal 3? Their people gave out false information."

To start, the plane was over 2 hours late, with no weather and no reason given. The boarding process was chaotic, both in the airport and onto the plane. But more importantly, although we were in business class, it wasn’t really business class. There were a few aisles —not separated in any way—in which they simply put a tray on the middle seat so that no one sits there. And those seats, like the rest, were extremely cramped and uncomfortable. I could not believe they called this business class."

After trying to use the voucher for a new flight, BA kept advising I couldn't as the voucher had been used. I asked them to check the status of that flight (as it never left) and the agent advised she didn't have access to that information. Two years in, I managed to speak to someone who recognised that either a voucher or refund was due and made a note on my record. I then decided to pursue a refund, as felt this would be less problematic. BA have acknowledged they owe me a refund. One phone call they said it will be with me in 18 working days. I then chased when it was long overdue. I was then told it will be with me in 21 working days. The refund never came. I try regularly to get through to Customer Service for the automated system to advise no agents are available. I have also sent two follow up messages via the case reference link they sent me, requesting an update, but with no response. Honestly feel very let down by BA who up until this, I felt were the more trustworthy and reliable airline. I suspect they will have ruined many trusted relationships with customers by now."
,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Mauritius,March 2022,,,,1.0,1,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  When I tried to check in, they required a certificate of insurance for Covid travel, but I did not have it, I tried for over 2 hours to get it issued, but my bank (where I had the travel insurance) the department that could issue the certificate was closed, it was 18:30. After a very long time, I got a cover letter which the bank sent to me, but then to be told I had missed the check in by 2 minutes. They would not let me board, and I missed the flight. So I contacted BA, and tried to rebook another departure flight, only to be told that because I missed my departing flight, my return flight had automatically been cancelled and this was BA policy. So then they worked out a new price to book the flights, but now the price was £3500. I originally paid £1500 for the flights. I then did a search on Google and found flights for £1100, flying out with Air Mauritius and returning with BA on the same flight I was originally supposed to return on. Unfortunately BA had made me miss 2 days of my holiday, I searched for over an hour but could not find anywhere on BA site that I needed the Insurance document. When I checked in for the Mauritius airways flight, they did not ask for the insurance document, and I had a lovely flight with no issues. Every time I fly with BA, I have a bad experience and I promise I will never fly with them again. "
A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Malaga,May 2022,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3,no,1.0,1.0,✅ Trip Verified |  Another dreadful mediocre experience with BA to Malaga. This time boarding was by bus and to a remote stand with no Aircon. Then on flight the the Wi-Fi was erratic and guests couldn’t order food or drinks. Then the card payment system didn’t work so we gave up on ordering. Finally at Malaga we were held up and not allowed to leave the plane as the bags had to come off first in case 'we' caused the plane to go unbalanced? Really? It’s all one excuse after another with BA these days.

No in-flight information as the in flight maps have long disappeared from European routes which is a shame. Staff was attentive though and tried their best."
Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,London to Mexico City,April 2022,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4,yes,3.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  This flight was not affected by recent problems with BA and I was quite impressed by the British Airways Premium Economy product in a new Boeing 787. Overall, Premium Economy turned out to be premium and clearly a step up from Economy towards Business Class. Also, the Premium Economy product came across much better in the Boeing 787 than in the old B747 or even than in the B777. Seat was very comfortable and had nice leg room. Food, service and entertainment options were good. Clearly worth the extra money for Premium Economy."
,Business,Economy Class,Glasgow to New York,May 2022,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1,no,4.0,4.0,"Not Verified |  British Airways continues to decline in customer service. I used to love this airline and now I have had three poor experiences back to back regarding their customer service on the phone with flight changes and vouchers. The most recent experience has cost me $3000 more than originally booked due to bad rep advice and multiple calls to the company. Even as part of the Executive Club (Silver) I continue to be left on hold for ages and in the last week have spent over 6 hours on the phone seeking support. At this rate, they have lost my trust."
,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Los Angeles,May 2022,1.0,5.0,,4.0,1,no,,,"Not Verified |  On my flight from LAX to LHR I paid to pick my seat for my flight back to LAX. I saw the $116 come out of my account the next day. As I’m adding in my booking the day before my flight, the website tells me I no longer have a booked seat and the seat I paid for has been sold to someone else. I spent an hour trying to find a way to contact their customer service and at first was told to DM the airline on Twitter which I find extremely inappropriate but I still reached out anyway because I was unable to find another way to contact them. On Twitter, I was told they were looking for an agent to help me and they never ended up responding. They just left my message unread. After about 6 hours of waiting for a Twitter DM back I ended up being able to find a chat line on their website. While talking to the agent on the chat line she informed me that they sold my seat to another customer and that she would book me a new seat, however she was unable to tell me where the seat was or how many people were in my row. After a frustrating conversation she was able to book me my original seat. Soon after I tried to pull up my booking in the British Airways app and was unable to find it. I would enter the booking reference and the site would say it was a success and the booking would show up once I refreshed the page but it did not. I continued to try and add the booking and the app would do the same thing every time, say it was a success then never add the booking. I’m not able to find the chat line again and I will not DM a company on Twitter with my support issues again. I’m extremely frustrated."

,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to London,May 2022,,,,,1,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked a flight to London and paid, months in advance, to upgrade my seat to an isle side exit row (front of the cabin + more legroom). Upon check-in, my expensive upgrade had been given away to someone else, and I was left to choose a miserable middle seat near the toilet. I spent an entire afternoon calling customer service. If my call went through at all (the automated system simply hangs up when it decides they are too busy) I was placed on indefinite hold, replete with elevator music and an insincere guarantee that my call mattered. I was greeted by someone with a heavy accent, over a very low quality, hard to hear line (I am 32 and not deaf). Sometimes, they would purposely hang up before I said anything. Other times, they would purposely hang up after I stated my plight. IF I managed to persist through all of that, for hours on end, they would hang up purposely after ""needing"" to put me on hold once more to ""speak with their supervisor."" In the end, BA managed to swindle me for hundreds of dollars, and I booked with another airline on principle. "
Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Cape Town,April 2022,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,no,,,"Not Verified |  We are on our way home after a 3 week holiday in the UK and have had all 4 flights with British Airways. Our 2 internal flights between London and Edinburgh were great due to the friendly staff and there were no complications, however, the 2 long haul flights have been a nightmare. Our initial flight from Cape Town to Heathrow was a full flight, the staff seemed very overwhelmed, they ran out of certain food and drinks and as we were in economy right at the back we got the ""leftovers"", my entertainment system was also not working. We are about to board the return flight from Heathrow to Cape Town and the check in process was horrific. I had booked through Expedia and somehow my return flight did not have a checked in bag allowance which I didn't realise until we checked in. I ended up having to pay an additional £85 for my bag, after being told to try do it under manage my booking on the app which was not possible and I also spent 20 minutes on hold trying to get through to the BA customer service number with no luck. We asked to speak to someone is person in terminal 5 and were told that they have no customer service desk in the main BA terminal.  Overall it took us about 2 hours to get me checked in after speaking to about 6 different staff members, none of which could help me. There was also a discrepancy with the baggage allowance as my friend I am traveling with was allowed 26kg and after paying to add my bag I was told it was overweight as I was only allowed 23kg and the bag was 24kg. Compared to having flown with other airlines I will never fly with BA again, the level of service is shocking compared to what you would expect."

I am a handicap and my family and I were afraid of this trip because I was flying alone and had a layover in London of a few hours. I had to change terminals and everything but thanks to a great service my trip was amazing. They took great care of me and made sure I was doing well throughout the whole flight.
A321 Neo,Family Leisure,Business Class,Madrid to London Heathrow,April 2022,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4,yes,,,"✅ Trip Verified | I connected into Madrid on Iberia and wrote a scathing review of their awful long haul business class service. British Airways short haul business class was in a totally different class. The cabin had 10 rows of seats in BC, a record for me. The staff met us at the door in a very cheerful way and this was a sign of the highly professional way they would continue to look after us throughout the flight. The messaging from cabin crew and flight crew was excellent. The food was first class, nothing was too much for the staff. Why, oh why can two members of the same company offer such different levels of sift and hard service? My thought is that it must be ingrained in the ethics of the company. British Airways keep up the good work, (it would be better if you had proper business class seats like some of your European competitors) overall you made me feel proud to be a Brit."
A320,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Dubrovnik to London Heathrow,April 2022,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,,,"Not Verified |  We flew from Dubrovnik to Heathrow on the 24th April 2022. Check in was very fast and we cleared security in about 15 minute, we made our way up to the lounge which just has the basic essentials but was clean and spacious. When boarding time came we had priority boarding and was the first few to board, welcomed by the cabin crew and given wipes, once seated we left more or less on tme had the safety brief taxiing for take off. Once airborne it was soon time for the drinks and meal services, choice of 3 main meal options which was very good, served by very friendly crew, the captain kept us informed about the progress of the journey arrived at Heathrow slightly early. Overall a very pleasant trip. We will be flying again with British Airways"
,Business,Business Class,London to Aberdeen,April 2022,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have always chosen to not make a big deal of the poor service, delays, dirty aircraft, over packed lounges, cabin crew etc experienced over the years but have lost all patience with this airline. Having paid almost £1K extra to change our return flight for the family, to get a flight at a specific time, BA cancelled this and placed us on another flight almost 10 hours later. There was no option to get any of the other available flights. The business class lounge at LHR was packed with hardly any space to move. The aircraft was filthy with food wrapping papers on my seat and floor. The seats were uncomfortable. Food for business class passengers included bread rolls passed in a basket. The poor level of hygiene, overcrowding, delays, cancellations makes this the worst airline I have had to endure. "
A320,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Pisa to London Heathrow,March 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1.0,1.0,"✅ Trip Verified | Business lounge was closed at Pisa airport which was probably beyond the control of British Airways but as it had been closed since January the least British Airways could have done would have issued their customers who paid for this service vouchers to be used at the airport, I complained about this to BA and as compensation they said they would credit my account with 10000 Avios points which I felt was an adequate compensation and at that point felt BA had handled the situation in a prompt and professional manner. However that was seven weeks ago and no Avios points have been added to my account, I have called their call centre multiple times at one point being put on hold for an hour to put through to the right department, when the phone was answered I was told it was the wrong department and to phone a number which was read out to me which was the same number I was calling! This scenario has replayed itself probably about twenty times now, it is clear that BA have no intention of resolving this and are just making their customer go round in circles before they give up, This airline is absolutely appalling in the way it treats its customers."

There were no announcements made, when approached no time frame was given, they simply didn't know. An aircraft had to be towed from a hanger at Johannesburg. Crew arrived late. The aircraft was filthy. We shall never fly Comair again that includes Kulula or BA absolutely shocking service."
A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Gothenburg to Manchester via London,April 2022,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,,1.0,Not Verified |  We had a trip with 4 flights included. All 4 flights were delayed. The worst with 2h15min. Also one flight was cancelled and we were rebooked to a 4h earlier flight loosing 4h of our short vacation. No explanation or compensation was given for the cancelled flights or delays. I expected a lot better as I have earlier used BA with good results. This was a really bad experience and I will avoid using BA for any further travels.

Excellent, lots of space and privacy, very good seat. I doubt if this can be bettered. Good staff as ever. My only quibble is that the food is all served at once. BA needs to roll this out quickly!"
,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Riyadh to Nice via London,April 2022,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2,no,3.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had an Incredible rude check in staff at the British Airways counter in Nice on 16th April 2022. Zero empathy towards me a struggling customer. Second situation happened when we arrived into Nice Terminal 1 on BA0262 13 April where my luggage did not make it on the same flight as me and had to put my details down for delivery. When our luggage arrived at Nice airport the day after and received an email from the AVIA Partner lost and found (British Airways Partner) at 13:14PM informing us that our luggage has now arrived in Nice. After multiple emails back and forth with emphasis on we were strongly expressing that I did not have clothes or shoes to wear and that we only had 3 short days in Monaco, it was vital we received the luggage ASAP, the lady replied “If it is so important why don’t you come and pick it up here at the airport or send your driver to pick it up” despite the fact that a proper delivery address was supplied to them from the very beginning. This has been an appalling experience."
,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Glasgow,April 2022,,,,,1,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  We booked a business class flight with Qantas from Melbourne to Glasgow via London. As Qantas fly to Heathrow, British Airways is their partner airline so we were automatically booked on BA from Heathrow to Glasgow. We booked this flight in October however 2 days before we were due to leave, we received an email from British Airways, advising that our flight from Heathrow to Glasgow has been cancelled. To help us out the email said, they had however booked us on another flight leaving from London City Airport, which is 26 miles from Heathrow Airport and the flight is going to Edinburgh, not Glasgow. Not sure how we were supposed to get from Glasgow, additionally it is in economy, not business class even though we had booked business class originally. We booked this as one connecting flight so British Airways know that we have just travelled 22 hours from Australia. There was no mention in the email about compensation for the change of class or additional travel costs in getting to another airport, nothing about possibly not accepting the flight given it was obviously never going to work for us and no contact details for British Airways. They also sent the email on Good Friday so even when I did eventually find a contact number, their office was closed. I have never experienced such terrible customer service with any airline I have ever flow on and I can guarantee I will never fly British Airways again. "
A380,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Glasgow to Washington via London,April 2022,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3,yes,3.0,3.0,"Not Verified |  The service was very good, the cabin crew were very kind and the boarding was very quick for an aircraft of this size. The seat was comfortable for economy and because the A380 walls are still expanding outwards on the first floor, there was a lot of space. The food was good for airplane food. The only bad thing was the ife screen was quite outdated and wasn't good quality, however there was a large selection of movies and TV shows"
A320neo,Business,Business Class,Malaga to London,April 2022,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2,no,,1.0,"✅ Trip Verified |  Total chaos for departures immigration at Malaga Airport. Boarding was quick, polite welcome by cabin crew. Beverage cart after take off was prompt, followed by lunch with a choice of 3 entrees. Food can best be described as wholesome, but not meeting quality levels of Air France, Swiss or Lufthansa short haul business class meals. Menu is still missing, and like many other aspects of the experience, BA cut a lot during Covid and have not reintroduced. I wouldn't mind, but on European trips in 2022, BA are charging up to 3 times the fare levels of 2019, and the overall value for money is now very poor. The WiFi did not work from start to finish of the flight. Crew said it had worked on the way out and the Captain had contacted London to get it fixed on the return. BA is becoming more and more shambolic, blaming far too much on Covid and it is time they took some responsibility for their failings.

,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Paris,March 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3,no,,,"Not Verified |  I am constantly amazed how British Airways continue to get things wrong - I pretty much though they had covered all those bases and in the last 15 years living in the UK, I have watched their decline with great sadness. My flight to Paris was no exception. Not only was the flight late, overcrowded and not managed at all by disinterested staff - that we sat on the tarmac, full boarded for one hour while we waited for catering to be loaded on (front and then back) left me gobsmacked. As they barely offer any food service anyway (small packet of crisps and an even smaller bottle of water) on a 45 minute flight, I wondered why they thought it was good operational planning to delay a whole plane load of passengers so that 6 people in business class could speedily eat a poor quality meal on the flight to Paris. As it transpired I was over 90 minutes late and missed the meeting I was flying to Paris to attend. Never again."
A320 / Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Phoenix to Paris via London,April 2022,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2,no,1.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  The short haul flights were the best with the crew on the final leg giving the excellent service that we all hope for. We chose out flights very carefully so that we were booked on flights with the Club World Suits not the Ying Yang arrangement that they still offer. At the last minute the aircraft was changed so we had to put up with the ying yang which really should have been pensioned off ages ago! Most business class offer 4 across but this layout still squeezes in 8 across. As we only take one long haul leisure trip a year in Business Class we always lose out on the ""Points game"" but I take exception to having paid in full on a non refundable basis not to be allowed to reserve my seats. The points gained from this trip alone would have allowed us Bronze status but we were not given this status until after the trip when it is useless to us. This status would have allowed us to book the seats 7 days prior to departure, when they were still available, rather than the 24 hours when they were not available. On the long haul return flight I was unable to book a window seat but on boarding after the doors had closed there was a window seat still vacant. I asked if I could move and was told by the FA she would check. Nothing happened but after take-off a passenger was moved from economy to that seat. Judging by the interaction between them I would bet it was someone on Staff Travel. I think it disgraceful that a full fare paying passenger should be treated like this. Take-off was just after 1930 hrs but we were not offered a drinks service before supper but were told we could order a drink that would be delivered on out tray with the meal. Had we done this our meal would have been cold by the time we ate it. In summary would I ever fly with BA again? No, not if I had half a chance of going with another airline. "

They have caused our family extreme stress and disappointment - we have tried for a week now to speak to someone as we can’t make the changes online. They hang up on you every time you call them - we have been driven to despair by their treatment of their customers. You can’t check in online, the application sucks so much you’re better off trying to code your own app and it’ll probably work better, every time you try to check in you are taken to a page that says we can’t verify your documents yet the app and website say you’re verified and ready to go. You upgrade and pay for upgrade and it says it’s guaranteed and then when you go to check in which you have to go to the airport for because online won’t work, they give you a different seat than you paid for and a lower class and offer nothing in return.

They have caused our family extreme stress and disappointment - we have tried for a week now to speak to someone as we can’t make the changes online.

I have no choice but to cancel our chance of a life time trip we’d booked with our 2 18 year old boys as they were flying with another airline and would have been alone in Japan as BA just cancelled our trip and we cannot rebook online as the trip was booked with avios and companion vouchers.

Easy check in, decent lounge experience except the very amiable staff were still forced to serve from behind barriers, very clean plane which left on time, ridiculous amount of legroom in 2D (it is a bulkhead seat but with lots more space than 1A or C), reasonable cooked breakfast served by a very attentive and capable CSM and arrived 15 mins earlier than scheduled. What's not to like, which is my overall experience with the vast majority of my BA experiences over the last 25 years. Anyway I thought it would be nice to read a positive review for once."

Food was ok as I have had better on BA in the past and I can understand why they put everything on a single tray which is OK. The cabin crew were brilliant but I was surprised that after dinner the crew didn’t once come round with beverages or even bottled water. BA really have a great hard product here and I would suspect the soft product will improve once Covid restrictions become less of an issue. Well done BA."

Out of 11 flights this year, not one has managed to depart or arrive at their destinations on-time. Including having 3 business class tickets cancelled and an alternative in economy being offered, still no refunds 3 months on and had a flight late and missed connection, so BA cancelled the rest of my ticket, leaving me stranded in the US.

A huge disappointment after going out in the new Club Class suites - the end of this awful yin and yang seating can't come soon enough. Even tried to pay BA's extortionate pre-booking rate for our seats - none left to choose even weeks ahead. My wife and I were stuck in the middle 2 seats of 4 - 13E and F. Good job it was an overnighter so we managed to sleep a bit and not have to climb over our neighbours very often. The March film selection so not good. Not particularly friendly FA who insisted face masks must be worn even though BA's policy has changed regarding flying back to a non-mask wearing destination (ie. London). Sort it out BA. Took off 20 minutes late but big tailwind so more than made up the time on a relatively smooth flight. Dinner not to bad but breakfast - fairly dire. My wife's smoked salmon bagel was dreadful. As usual when BA is good, it's really good but when it's bad it's awful. I recommend hesitatingly - come on BA, be great again. We pay a lot for ""premium"" seats."
,Business,Economy Class,Heathrow to Bologna,April 2022,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,,,"Not Verified |  The worst budget airline I’ve ever used! Far worse than Ryanair and I refuse to fly with them even though they’re basically free. BA charge about 10x as much as other budgets but have the worst service. Spent an hour checking in because their outdated computers crashed. They left us sat on the plane for over 2 hours because they couldn’t connect to the internet, then left 50% of our luggage behind because they would have had to refund everyone’s flights if they waited another 10 mins for the other luggage trolleys to arrive. It took three days to return it and cost us £100s. Then on return I’ve now been sat here nearly two hours and there’s no sign of our luggage again. I don’t know how a company can be this incompetent but I’ll be pursuing for compensation. I have some free flights from Amex but I won’t be using them because it’s not worth going through this again."

The infrastructure however is appalling. ZRH-LHR impossible to check-in online and just 2 staff to check-in everyone for 2 flights resulting in mislabelled luggage and an hour delay to sort this out. GVA-LHR, 2.5hrs late as no-one at LHR to tow the aircraft to the gate. LHR-ZRH, 50mins late due to slow gate staff. Even when you check-in online you have to queue at the airport to get the actual boarding pass! There are more examples, and for this reason, until they sort out their stressed ground staff, it is impossible to recommend this airline. Onboard 10/10, getting to be onboard 1/10."

Hard uncomfortable seats, small aged tv screens with limited inflight entertainment. Food and service appalling. 13hr plus flight, no socks, eye shades, ear plug amenity pack. And no antibacterial wipes offered. Wi-Fi advertised but not available on flight. Paid premium money for a budget airline, more akin to Easy Jet, RyanAir or JetStar. My last time travelling with BA after more than 18 years of flying with them. BA you really do need to buck up your service and become the flagship Service you used to be."

A huge improvement on the old yin and yang Club Class which we unfortunately endured on the way back. Comfortable, big TV screen with high quality picture and good headphones, plenty of nooks and crannies for storing small items and very private. Nice friendly FA's (called by my name from the off) and pretty good drinks service with a good dinner served. Once again let down by a poor (at best) choice of movies on the in-flight entertainment system. Thank goodness the latest James Bond movie was showing. Took off and landed on time. Smooth flight. Only one letdown - the usual extortionate fee charged for pre-booking a seat. Come on BA, stop nickel and diming - it spoils what could be a really good Business Class product and after all we already pay quite a bit for the privilege. I recommend with the usual caveats."

After the chaos of Cape Town Airport passenger handling with incredibly long queues to get through security and then passport control taking nearly two hours in total we arrived at the lounge somewhat frazzled and were very happy to find a quiet area with decent wine and appropriate food choices for a break before boarding the flight. Boarding went well and we were seated and offered a small half full glass of champagne. The captain made an announcement to say that we were all aboard ahead of schedule and that the flight time would be shorter than scheduled but unfortunately this would mean our arrival would be too early to land due to the 6.00 am lifting of the overnight jet ban at Heathrow so we would have to wait on the ground for perhaps half an hour or so. This was no big deal. Then the captain announced that due to IT issues at Heathrow they could get not compile necessary paperwork so we would be delayed for an indefinite period. With the delay of uncertain duration one might have hoped for a further offering of champagne or other beverage in particularly for Business Class but this was not forthcoming. In the event take off was permitted quite soon after. The crew had distributed menus but then did a PA to say that there were changes to each of the main courses. A drinks order was taken for pre dinner drinks, for main course for dinner and choice of wine with dinner. Drinks and nuts were served circa 45 minutes after take off, in my case a small measure of white wine in the bottom of a pleasant and decent sized tumbler and my husband had another half glass of champagne. Dinner arrived on a single tray with a small measure of red wine in the tumbler. The food looked bland, unappetising and tasted the more so. The cheese (two small pieces) were sitting in a greasy pool of vinegary chutney. No top up of the wine was offered (we did ask for a second glass and it was provided on a very individualised basis) and coffee was not served since we had hit some mild turbulence. The flight was some 11 hours in duration and no other snacks or beverages were offered prior to breakfast which was provided separately to each passenger as they showed signs of being awake. Breakfast was slightly more edible than dinner. Coffee or tea were offered by individual mug, orange juice was available on request. Cabin crew were largely absent from the cabin except during the meal services but it must be said that they were extremely pleasant and were suitably responsive to requests for individual items. Come on British Airways you can and need to do better than this if you are to meet customer expectations and compete with other airlines on similar routes. For the cost of a business class ticket passengers are enjoying only additional space and seat comfort (flatbed) as a benefit over an economy ticket at or below 25% of the price paid for the premium cabin. Time was when flying in Business Class was real treat, no longer is this the case."
,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Heathrow,March 2022,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4,no,1.0,,"Not Verified |  Our main complaint is that the limited food served was bland, barely edible, and by far the worst we’ve ever experienced compared to other airlines used in the past. The staff were friendly enough but they were rarely seen between meals. No snacks were offered during the flight. This is so different to every other airline we have used in the past. After 14 hours of flying the breakfast offered was a tiny, cold, stale, Ham and cheese roll and a small plain yoghurt with a couple of Oreos. If ever you decide to fly with them I suggest that you bring your own food. We certainly will on our return flight but will never use British Airways again."
A320,Business,Business Class,London to Malaga,March 2022,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,no,1.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  Complete and utter chaos at Heathrow, yet again. Surely the CEO, Sean Doyle, must now take responsibility and step aside for the consistent and continuous IT problems that cause flights to be cancelled and delayed. The queue for the First Wing check in at 10am today was over 1 hour, and subsequent flight to Malaga 1.5 hrs late leaving the gate. Updated about the delays 3 times, but strangely not one person apologised or said sorry - BA seems to think this is normal practice nowadays. As Emerald OneWorld, I wish there was an alternative because BA has become intolerable, and this is after flying them for 55 years since BEA/BOAC days."
,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to London via Dublin,March 2022,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,no,,,"Not Verified |  Feb 25, 2022. We show up at the airport 3 hours early for our flight to Dublin. we waited in line for 3+ hours to just check in our luggage. After that, we learn our flight is delayed another 3+ hours. We had a connecting flight in London. When trying to go through customs they wouldn't let us through because the boarding of the plane was going to be happening in 30 minutes. They told us to wait in a customer service line that was well over an hour. We then found out we could have gone through customs because the connecting flight from London to Dublin was delayed over an hour. However, by the time we were told this information, the doors were about to close. The next available flight to Dublin was 2/27 late evening. With that being said we were forced to stay the night in London. After talking to a British Airways manager, they informed us that BA would reimburse us for any hotel, flight (to get to Dublin regardless of the airline), clothes (due to them losing our bags), excursions and transportation. Due to this issue, we had to spend multiple days shopping for clothes, lost out on days we had booked to explore the country, had to now buy an extra suitcase for the new clothes we received (went 4 days with lost bags). When we finally got home, we submitted our claims like we were told to do. Within a few days, it's declined. We have asked for a contact # just to talk to somebody, again declined. We tried to reach out via social media and we get passive-aggressive messages.  They refuse to pay me back for the new flight to get to Dublin, transportation to and from the airport in London, the hotel for London, the clothes I had to buy because they lost my bags for 4 days, and the extra luggage fee because of the extra clothes I had to buy. There is no customer support and they are impossible to get a direct response from."
Boeing 777-200,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Cape Town to London,March 2022,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2,no,2.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways are in the process of upgrading all its 777 fleet to the new Club Suite, but BA59 had the 16-yrs-old, packed-like-sardines Club World product. The lounge at CPT was also bursting at the seams and food orders were so behind that many passengers had left by the time their food arrived. On boarding, we were surprised to find that the menu, amenity kit and bottle of water had already been placed in the storage drawer. We suspect this is another cynical time-saving initiative on the part of BA. Frustratingly, the menu turned out to be incorrect and the replacement dishes were probably the worst we have ever encountered in any business class on any airline. The drinks run was cancelled without any warning on the spurious basis of a passenger with a nut allergy. It's hard to avoid suspicions that cabin crew were being economical with the truth. Apart from a rather turbulent ride, the flight was otherwise uneventful and arrival was slightly ahead of schedule. Baggage handling was, however, atrociously slow."
,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Funchal,March 2022,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  We flew to Funchal, Madeira yesterday. Madeira has no COVID restrictions for entry, yet BA asked us to upload our NHS vaccination passes, before we could check in online. I received an OK about an hour later, but my husband did not, so I couldn’t check in online. We arrive at Heathrow 2 hours before departure and stood in a long queue for check in. There were just 3 desks open for a queue of approx 100 travellers. Then several people went on breaks or disappeared so we were down to one desk open, with the queue barely moving. I went to complain to various BA staff, who said the manager had been told and more people were coming. One blonde lady walked around for ages, shepherding travellers into the queue, before sitting down at a desk. Another man later did likewise, making us wonder why they hadn’t simply worked at the desks from the beginning. All in all we stood in that queue for a good hour, before almost running to the security queue, which thankfully moved quickly. Then we hurriedly bought a sandwich, walked to our departure gate and stood on the bus to the plane. The whole experience was extremely stressful; and took the best part of 2 hours. We did not have time to sit down until we did so on the plane. And completely unnecessary! If we had been able to check in online, this would not have happened. My husband’s vaccination pass is fine, but not required for Madeira. I think it is a systems failure as he received an email yesterday morning saying his pass was not in order, as did I, even though I’d previously been told, I could check in online. Also unnecessary as if BA had staffed the desks properly the queue would have moved. A staff member told us BA had laid off lots of staff during lock down and was now begging them to return, but having been treated badly, they didn’t want to. The flight itself was fine, on time. We were given a bag of crisps and a bottle of water, again fine, nothing praise worthy."

Boeing 787-9,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Austin,March 2022,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3,no,1.0,,"Not Verified |  Flew BA LHR-AUS on a 787-9 on the outbound leg and then back on the A350-1000 on the return leg. Seats comfortable. Staff service on the inbound leg was disappointing. Safety briefing was missed on LHR-AUS route. LHR-AUS boarding on time, flight flew out on time, landed on time. AUS-LHR boarding one hour late, left an hour late and landed one hour late too. Food quality on both legs was not fit for human consumption. Wife ordered a veg meal which was served cold on both legs. In flight entertainment on outbound leg was bad - 2/3 screens not working. On return leg worked fine, but this is due to the A350-1000 being brand new. Good quality of sleep on both legs, which was good. Check in at LHR was flawless and without incident. Check in at AUS was rotten. We queued and were number 4 in line and waited for 1 hour for staff to check us in. What was clear is staff quality in Austin is poor, passengers did not appear to have passenger locator form(s) ready / VeriFly app ready and / or vaccine detail ready. Having looked at business and premium economy class on both legs, paying business class and premium economy did not appear worth it. Baggage was received fine at AUS and LHR - the latter took ages on return. If I had the option of another airline - I would not fly BA."

Boeing 787-900,Solo Leisure,First Class,Singapore to London,March 2022,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2,no,4.0,,"✅ Trip Verified | I really can’t believe they have the audacity to call this First Class. The check in staff at Singapore were abrupt and unhelpful. The official BA lounge in Singapore was closed, so they’re using a cheap generic alternative, which anyone can pay twenty pounds to go in. Suffice to say it was not pleasant. Onboard was like being in the middle of a bad comedy sketch. I can not believe the two stewardess have ever had any first class training. I had to ask for slippers. The first drink took nearly an hour to arrive, despite only having 8 passengers to serve between the two of them. The poor woman sat next to me ordered a wine, which came filled to the brim. I mean it’s First Class, not a student house party. Neither had any knowledge of the wines on the menu. Most of the food was awful. My steak was dry, over cooked and tough, and whichever catering manger signed off on a canapé of soggy mushroom on top of a chunk of polenta should be sacked immediately. I will say, the cheese and port were nice. However the worst thing was the constant galley noise. There was a cart stowage immediately in front of my seat (1K) which they were in and out of all night, and appeared incapable of shutting without slamming. They also seemed to have stored their personal belongings in to the bin immediately above my seat, so we’re in and out of that as well. I will say the seat itself is very well designed, but personally I’m happy in Club and would never do First again."
A350,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dublin to Dubai via London,March 2022,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3,no,1.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Dubai. Family of 6 kids where from 10 down to 6 years old, savvy travelers, been on many holidays so we were excited to be on BA for first time. But disappointment became desperation as we had not eaten anything since Dublin that morning at 7am. We had no time to eat at LHR so thought we'll get something usually around 1 hour into the flight. 3.5 hours after take off they served out food. Food was fine but nothing special, no issues with beverage, no attention to kids as you'd expect from many other airlines, even a kids book would be good. Movies are all outdated and already watched. So overall very medium experience."
,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Cairo,February 2022,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified | One would think that the number of crises BA incurs they would have had emergency planning down to a fine art. I last flew with BA May 2017 - yes, the weekend of the last but one IT crisis. I swore never again but ended up purchasing a ticket Aug 2018 to Bologna - BA cancelled the flight. Then covid hit so ended up with a voucher. Fast forward to Feb 26th, 2022. Received a message 5.30am 30mins from LHR that that my flight was cancelled. Arrived at the airport with everyone else just wandering and seeking answers. The staff that were there either told you to go online - a bit difficult as the BA systems were down or ring BA. Ha Ha or go home - not very helpful if you live two hours from LHR. By some miracle the app sprung into life, and I managed to get one of the last 10 seats on the evening flight. Sat in arrivals as there was a coffee shop - soon ran out of seats. By 12.00 midday most of us were trying to get airside to use lounges but no one was allowed in departures until two hours prior to your flight supposedly because of crowds. Pointed out BA should have provided refreshments - told to put a claim in. Eventually got to departures and made it through security. BA customer services (note the oxymoron) - had a consistent queue of about 20 people as BA were still cancelling/rearranging flights for passengers who were airside. Boarded flight 45mins late. Sat on tarmac as the pilot told us the delay was them trying to 'reconcile' luggage. When we took off given one very small bottle of water and a cereal bar for a five-hour flight They purport to be a top-class airline but in fact Ryanair has more finesse. The staff are fine but can be miserable because they are treated so badly and like to remind you that they are doing their best in a difficult situation - well so are the passengers. The aircraft are cramped and worn. I had been reluctant to use Egyptair but flew home with them on a new aircraft with a very good entertainment system and was provided with a hot meal and snack for same price as a BA ticket. How on earth can BA justify their prices? The management should be sacked as ultimately they are to blame for the ruination of this airline."
,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Male to London,March 2022,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3,no,3.0,,"Not Verified |  We will never use BA again for a long haul flight. Our experience of the flight from LHR-MLE wasn’t too bad, apart from a screaming child but the return wasn’t a good experience. We weren’t provided with a drink when we boarded as we were forgotten and that happened a few more times during the flight. I think the crew in Premium Economy were very young and not very experienced, leaving the experienced ones in Business/First. Actually, I think BA only care about the Business/First customers now with the cabins getting larger for those classes. They ran out of food choice 8 rows back in our cabin (it’s not a large cabin), ran out of wine straight after the food service and we had no food for 7hrs apart from a couple of biscuits, one of those we had to go and get from the kitchen. We weren’t fed until 1.5hrs before we landed (it was a 11.5hr flight) and then it was a soggy roll containing 2 slices or cucumber and 2 slices of tomato! BA just don’t care anymore about the little people."

Luggage is taking hours to arrive.  No communication whatsoever from anyone. They can't be reached on the phone and answer with delays to emails, if they do. My app is crashing most of the times. They change the aircraft without notice, so even if you pay for a seat, the staff will say there is nothing they can do."

I understand that they were not required to help due to the delayed flight being a different airline. What's worse is that they went ahead and canceled our tickets for our connecting flight, which we would have been able to make based on another flight out we found, causing us to have to buy much more expensive tickets home that resulted in us having an overnight layover and having to buy a hotel room on top of ridiculously expensive last minute tickets. The absolute worst customer service I have ever dealt with, and I will never be flying with them again."
Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Cape Town to Glasgow via London,February 2022,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3,yes,3.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight took off two hours late after what can only be described as a shambles at the airport. No airbridge to the aircraft which is not acceptable. The aircraft was better than the outbound flight, who screen was so small. After serving only about 2/3rd of the cabin, no first choice. Only a vegetarian dish or a chicken dish from the economy cabin. The airline must know that vegetarians will order a meal, so why include it as a choice. Also, to offer a roll of ham/cheese for breakfast after a 12 hour flight is cost saving. A hot breakfast should be offered. With only 90 minutes between my connecting flight, due to late arrival, I made staff aware. Whilst they let me and others passengers of the flight first, there was no staff to assist in getting us to our flight. It was a struggle to get my connecting flight. On arriving in Glasgow, got txt to say my bags did not make the flight. First time using BA premium and likely my last."

Boeing 777-200,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Cape Town,March 2022,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3,no,1.0,,"✅ Trip Verified | The economy cabin was surprisingly underpopulated on this flight, with only about 30 passengers, but business class was three-quarters full. Boarding was therefore mercifully quick and take-off on schedule. Sadly, BA59 makes use of the old Club World product, which now seems like a step back in time after experiencing the new Club Suite on BA42/43. There are some good points about the old Club World - the drawer capable of taking a laptop and the more comfortable seat when flat - but other than those, it's an embarrassment. The tiny, poorly responsive screen is almost beyond belief. Service was perfunctory and the meal service conformed to the current, overly cautious, post-Covid requirements, with everything served at the same time. This does mean that the meal is over and done with relatively speedily, but it's a lacklustre experience in contrast to BA's competitors and smacks of continued cost-cutting. Queues for the three toilets in business class were unacceptable at times and there was limited attention paid to keeping them clean. Arrival was on schedule, but Covid paperwork processing meant that it was an hour before we were able to collect our baggage."

We flew business class and the experience was like economy from 20 years ago except you can have a glass of champagne. We were packed in full 3x3 seats because of IT issue the day before. Even if weren’t, the Seat pitch and width is the same as economy. Gone are the little pretend tables in the middle seat to give some illusion of style. The food was dreadful. The in flight service was unsophisticated. BA used to have an acceptable European business class. They don’t any more. Other European airlines offer much better in flight experience in business class in comparison. BA is taking premium and frequent flyers for granted and treating us like mugs. How I miss the politeness of old BA business class from around 5 years ago, how I used to look forward to it, the small gestures like hanging up a coat, giving you a hot towel, having nice food, being served from the galley, rather than from the manky trolley. COVID is not the reason - this is years of cost cutting and the result is dreadful."

BA454 from London to Malaga on 25th February, and across 6 visible rows around me there were 7 out of 24 passengers wearing face masks - and I was one of them. This was long after the meal / drinks service had been cleared, and remained like that as we landed and deplaned. Cabin crew were frequently up and down the aisles and not a word was said to any of these non compliant passengers, or as they left the aircraft with staff bidding them farewell. I guess they are too scared to remind people to follow the rules? "

,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Edinburgh,February 2022,,,,1.0,1,no,,,Not Verified |  Another episode of unmitigated shambles when it comes to customer service. The day after Storm Eunice and English half term holidays are getting underway. So you make allowances and you accept there could be some delays. The fact they were then compounded by the late cancellation of a raft of flights to domestic and European destinations on the evening of Saturday 19 February for operational reasons was pitiful. You could not rebook via BA’s website. Instead passengers were compelled to queue at Gate A17 at LHR to possibly rebook and be provided with accommodation overnight. Some BA cabin crew were helpful but those in customer services in the South Lounge who simply directed passengers to the ever growing queues at A17 were a disgrace.

Allowed evening before check in , this allowed lots of time for staff to help with paperwork needed for travel to the US. On the day of travel it was half term and the Airport busy. In spite of this through security and into lounge in 5 minutes. Lounge clean, staff proactive and food served quickly. Good range of drinks. Easy transfer to C gates. Aircraft ready, boarding quick and well organised. Pre departure drinks served. The cabin crew were excellent and provided a very good service. The food was the new club world menu options ( roast beef) which was excellent. Although it was the older club world product it was clean and well maintained. On time arrival, baggage off very fast. Overall an excellent flight and it feels like BA are improving their offering at a time when many other providers use COVID as an excuse for service cut backs Well done"

The cabin was clean and well maintained, seats were comfortable, food and drinks were good (including a very tasty Hertfordshire roast pork on the return leg), and the BA cabin crews remain the best in the business. This was one of a number of bookings that I had to re-book a number of times due to flight cancellations, and contrary to the experience of many here, my re-bookings were handled courteously and thoroughly (although I did have a number of lengthy waits on hold, but under the present circumstances that's to be expected). It's good to see that the everyday product has held up so well amid this dreadful time, and I'm looking forward to future trips on BA."
,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Montréal to Dubai via London,February 2022,,,,,4,yes,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had the best experience I have ever had with an airline. Our initial flight to Dubai was canceled By Royal air Maroc and we had to find a new flight at the last minute. I found that booking with them was extremely simple. Unfortunately, we had to cancel our flight the day of the departure. I called the customer service, waited about 20 minutes before I could speak with someone and within 15 minutes, the flight was canceled and they offered me a full refund. The person on the line was extremely nice, understanding and willing to help us. I had never dealt with such a nice employee from any airline. I got the full refund on my credit card the day after. I usually chose the cheapest flight ticket, regardless of the airline, but from now on, I’ll definitely make sure to check with British airways first."

We had no issue with this, just enjoyed an extra days holiday but others might not have been so flexible. However, they overlooked rebooking our connecting flight from LHR and we were fortunate that there was still space on the flight when we checked in at ATL. The aircraft was newish and in excellent condition, flight was around 50% capacity. Service was excellent, staff were friendly and efficient. Dinner was good, breakfast was disappointing with little choice. The LHR to BHD leg was equally good and I am beginning to think that BA are getting their mojo back again."
Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Cape Town to London Heathrow,January 2022,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3,yes,4.0,,"✅ Trip Verified | Boarding was slow and uncomfortable on account of the lack air-con at the gate. The Club Suite cabins were about 3/4 full, but the rest of the plane can't have been much more than 20% occupancy. Whether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the bare minimum is hard to say, but they certainly had to work hard covering multiple cabins. Despite that, the drink and food service in business was efficient, and the current policy of serving all courses at once meant that dinner was done and dusted two hours after take-off, which is a real bonus on a night-time flight. However, the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish was almost inedible. The Club Suite is a big improvement on the ancient CW product, although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartments that invite losing a smartphone or two. One definitely misses the drawer at foot level in old CW. The large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole IFE system was much more responsive. The new seats don't significantly aid sleeping, particularly as there's an obvious ridge at the level of the base of the spine. Waking up two hours before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to get breakfast over and to avoid the usual queues for the toilets. Performance of the flight deck was up to its usual high standard and arrival was twenty minutes ahead of schedule. Progress through border control was speedy but baggage collection was delayed for unspecified reasons. Overall, a good flight."
Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London Heathrow to Orlando,January 2022,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3,no,1.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  Unfortunately having just flown in the new club world cabin this time we had an incredibly old plane. The good was the cabin crew who tried to make the trip as pleasant as possible. The bad was the in-flight entertainment, the screens were unwatchable when they worked, my wife’s didn’t, and post iPad era just don’t live up. The food was just about okay without being anything special but all served at once. Apparently the crew explained this is because of a shortage of staff. I’m afraid BA has a lot to do to regain its standing in the aviation world, the competition is too fierce now to sit on your laurels."
A380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Dubai,January 2022,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,2.0,,"Not Verified |  Utterly appalling company. We've flown with them two times now, and both times it's been a disaster. The first time: Return flight was delayed by over 24 hours. There was nobody at the gate to tell us this, so a large group of passengers had to roam round Dubai airport looking for BA staff. There were none. Eventually another airline told us to go down some unmarked stairs, where a very angry person told us it was our fault, and we should have been given a letter. We had no letter. They then put us on a bus to the other terminal. When we arrived, there was nobody to greet us. We were literally just left there. We had to, yet again, contact another airline, who managed to find us transport to the hotel. When we got there, we were told it was full and we couldn't choose our rooms. We were given a terrible, dirty, cramped room. Several times throughout the night we were called to tell us our flight had been moved. Eventually we got to board the next day. My tray table was broken, as was the window blind, and I didn't get a meal. No compensation was offered. The second time I need to reschedule my flight. The website assured me this was fine, but provided no link. I needed to phone up. If you need to phone BA, don't even bother trying. I never got to speak to anyone, and just ended up booking a hotel to wait for my flight rather than rescheduling. The food has been terrible, meagre portions given infrequently. My sandwich was inedible.

,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Newcastle via London,November 2021,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4,no,4.0,,Not Verified | Over the past 2 years I have flown with British Airways twice and ended up in the exact same predicament of having to wait around all day in London Heathrow for a 1 hour flight home to Newcastle. While the holidays and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and the staff at Heathrow are useless. First time in February 2020 I got stuck in Heathrow due to Storm Ciara when travelling home from work which was not the airlines fault. However the handling of the situation by the staff at the airport was a joke. They had 4 to 5 staff ran a kiosk queue of over 100+ unhappy travellers whilst they could have set up mini kiosks on the unused gates to get through everyone quicker. Their was no crowd control and at one point after queuing for 2 hours plus the staff decided to shut up shop. In the end after a 12 hour battle I was lucky enough to get home on the last flight of the day through sheer luck when I finally spoke to someone. In November 2021 I decided to give BA a second chance and booked to go to New York. Since the plane landed late into LHR I missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at Heathrow had assisted me or held the plane for a short while. As I rushed through customs I did manage to make it to the gate with 5 minutes to spare and the plane still in the terminal but since they had taken my luggage off the flight they told me to go to the service desk and refused to let me on since they had moved me on to a later flight. My layover was now 10 hours and all I got from the guest services was a £12 food voucher to spend and a phone number for what I thought was complaints but after being on hold for 20 minutes found out it was not from complaints. Considering the fact this could have all been avoidable with more assistance to have only been given a food voucher for £12 seemed really cheap. A few days after I got home I then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed I was and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up only to find the complaints staff were not working. When I got a response I said I wanted 20-25% back off my holiday. I got an apology and told the staff at Heathrow will be better but in terms of good will and compensation I was offered nothing! 
Boeing 737-800,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Cape Town to Durban,January 2022,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3,yes,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  Return trip Cape Town to Durban in Club Class highlighted the inconsistency. Our outbound trip in December was good in all respects, whereas the return trip was disappointing. Check in was fine, apart from the agent failing to label one of bags priority, resulting in a long wait for our third bag. The lounge was busy, but no complaints. We went to the boarding gate at the check in time indicated on the screen, where there was no sign of activity, although the screen was still showing the same gate and departure time. Shortly thereafter two ground staff appeared and when approached said the flight was delayed from 1330 to 1410 and the gate was changed to the lower level bus gates. The informational screens had now updated to the delayed time and new gate. I checked on the flight radar app, which showed that our aircraft had started in Durban, and flown to Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, back to Cape Town, and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight. In fact looking at its schedule and turn around times it was always going to be late. Boarding eventually started at 1400 with departure at 1430, 60 minutes late. Drinks service only started 30 minutes later, followed by lunch. The food was good but the wine offering very mediocre, and not up to club standards. With the price of good wines in South Africa there is no excuse for serving poor wine. Lunch service was quick, but then the crew disappeared behind the curtain and there was no offering of top up drinks unless specifically requested. Overall this was a disappointing flight with a lacklustre crew"
,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Durban to Cape Town,January 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  I used British Airways for the first time and I have to admit that I am impressed with their service! Firstly, I want to thank the lady that assisted me to weigh my luggage. My flight was 16:10, however due to unforeseen circumstances, I arrived at the airport around 15:40. I was convinced that I was going to miss my flight because the queue was very long. I stood there a few minutes but then realized that I would miss my flight. I went to ""Club check-in"" and the lady was incredibly kind to me. I just cannot believe how patience she was with me even though I was at fault. She weighed my luggage and I was able to board the flight successfully. I was not aware that this airline gives out free meals. We got a sandwich and drink and we had an option to choose between vegetarian and chicken. I personally love free stuff so I will be ditching Flysafair (even though they have excellent service as well) in the near future, unfortunately. Diversity; The first time I flew was in 2018 and I have to admit that I have never seen such diversity amongst cabin crew staff however with British Airways it was different.  The staff was very kind and friendly as well. What a wonderful experience to fly with these guys!"
,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Bangalore to Detroit via London,January 2022,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,3.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  I recently had the unfortunate privilege of travelling on British Airways from Detroit to Bangalore and back. Given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layovers, I decided to spend extra and get a business class ticket. I was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that I was special because I spent that extra money or was in Business class. From shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff, I experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeys. The trump was being stranded in London having missed my connection and spending close to 3 hours to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flight. Being a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turn. Some special passengers were escorted to the Club World check in. When we asked the lady, she told us to continue standing where we were and she would come back to get us when the counter freed up. Needless to say it never did. Finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked. So I come back to the question: Can big corporations lie with no accountability? Why would I spend my hard-earned money on something that gave me nothing extra? Shame on you British Airways for your complete disregard for your passengers. Stop your lying or update your promises!"
,Business,Economy Class,New York to London,January 2022,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2,no,3.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have flown with BA for many years and today was another poor experience as I’ve witnessed the airline decline into a sub-par service. I understand that it’s been a tough two years for airlines but BA’s decline started before the pandemic and it has now truly plummeted. Enormous queues at JFK BA check-in terminal 7. Even the priority lane was at a standstill for at least half an hour before people started complaining they’d miss their flights. Terrible efficiency at the check-in counters. At times, only one member of staff is processing people whilst other BA staff stood around on their phones or having a chat. One member of staff stopped processing a man desperately trying to catch his flight in order to start processing someone else who had jumped in. The interior of the plane was generally filthy, crumbs, bits of food, stains, marks all around the seating area. They give you a single wet wipe which I used to think was for your hands but now I see most passengers wiping down their surrounding area. There are some very good and courteous members of staff but there are also some awful members of staff who behave unprofessionally. On this particular flight one of the cabin crew is as swearing about his colleague at the back of the plane who apparently wasn’t pulling his weight. Very poor. I used to be a proud BA flyer but now I just feel like I’m clinging on to my airline status which doesn’t actually provide you a better service these days."
,Business,Economy Class,Las Vegas to London ,January 2022,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  The entertainment selection was sub par, minimal selections and the new releases were  not new releases. My food left something to be desired. Two of the seats in our row the earphone jack didn’t work. The plane was either uncomfortably hot or too cold, find a medium temp. Just overall a very basic generic airline."
,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Dubai,October 2021,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,3.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  Straightforward and friendly baggage drop. On to South Lounge, no polite conversation on have you used our lounge before, no indication that it was so busy there was nowhere to sit at all considering even the 1.5m distancing. Had to roam the entire lounge, lugging our bags on the carpeted floor, with no success at all. Gave up after 20 minutes and decided to try another lounge. Arrived and everything was actually right in front of us and actually found somewhere to sit after 5 minutes of looking around. Menu was basic with no eggs, hash browns or any breakfast cakes or muffins. Ordered a frittata as was so hungry. Made my way to the self-serve coffee counter which had basic coffee and was straight away put off by flies hovering over the croissants and fruit. Flight was departing from a gate where you had to take a train to and as if to rub salt in the wound were then told that DXB flight usually leaves from there and should’ve gone to the lounge near there. Looking at the individual cubicles which was to be honest our top reason for choosing business class gave me heart. However, the doors cannot close till take off. I asked for the artisan crisps or biscuits on the Menu and it took them over an hour. Lunch came in another almost hour. Asked if could swap puddings as am not a crumble person, said will surely try but clearly didn’t, with no apologies or even trying. Portions were small, plus saw quite a few fellow passengers sleeping through lunch so asked if could have more but all was finished. Chocolates are Lindor. Nothing special about the other amenities, toilets were no different to what you’d expect, amenity kit was basic, duvet seemed well used. It was not worth almost 4 times the amount of a regular ticket. Naive to trust claims of world class standards."
,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Warsaw to London,December 2021,2.0,4.0,,1.0,2,no,,,"Not Verified | On arrival at the Warsaw Airport the check in zone was the only one that was not announced on the flight board - we had to guess and ask random people where to go. Once we finally found the check-in desks, luggage drop and check-in was appalling. It took us over 1.5 hours to get our bags checked (and we were half way through the queue). The whole process was disorganised and very slow, really the last thing you want when looking after 2 small, impatient kids. Lady in Warsaw Airport who was supposed to direct passengers to the correct queue was useless. One check-in desk for Euro Traveller / Club Europe, one for bag drop and one for the check-in.  Flight left delayed but the pilots managed to catch up and landed with a small delay, crew on the plane was nice and attentive. Luckily the in air experience was much better, but sort out your ground service at Warsaw Airport."
A319,Business,Business Class,Glasgow to London Heathrow,December 2021,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  In Glasgow one check in desk open. Huge queue with no business check in. It took me close to an hour to bagdrop. Getting onto the aircraft in Glasgow, no hello from the crew and the same getting off.  I normally find BA cabin crew very nice. Breakfast was a very tired looking croissant.  I used the BA lounge in Terminal 3. Not very keen on the new table service. Poor choice and miniscule portions. Lounge staff were very nice in both directions. On arrival at LHR there was a coach transfer from T5 to T3. We were packed in like sardines. So much for social distancing. The flight from LHR to Pisa was delayed and once we boarded we sat on the aircraft for another 2hrs 30 mins. Captain advised us that there was no tow truck for push back and when it did eventually arrive there were no baggage handlers to load the containers. No drinks or anything offered while we waited. Food was not even worth mentioning. As far as Club Europe goes it's not worth the extra cost. No priority baggage as mine were last onto the belt in Pisa, seats are economy seats with the centre one blocked off. The first officer summed it up when we arrived in Pisa- Sorry folks this trip was a pretty poor show by BA, and he was right. For the return trip on Hogmanay we left on time. I've never been on a flight to or from Pisa which has left in time. Pisa lounge is nice enough but the food choice is laughable. On board I gave the food a miss.  Heathrow back to Glasgow Flight left on time. Food was an antipasto of some sort which I declined.  Both cases were last off again. Club Europe is really not worth the money as you are in an economy cabin. I would have thought that BA would do more about their food and onboard service since the cabin is what it is."
Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Cape Town,December 2021,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3,yes,5.0,1.0,"✅ Trip Verified | After two years of being unable to fly to our second home in South Africa because of COVID, it was fantastic to be back on board a BA flight to CPT, and in the Club Suite seats (1K and 2K) to boot. These seats are a huge improvement on the old yin-yang CW seats in terms of privacy, ease of access and the IFE screen, but the cabin still felt densely occupied and the seats were just as uncomfortable when lying flat. Storage was a mixed blessing, too, with three rather fussy little compartments rather than the decent sized drawer in the old CW, meaning that a laptop would have to be stored above. The food onboard was woeful, although serving all three courses at the same time does at least mean that the dinner service isn't dragged out. Cabin crew went about their business dutifully but with little enthusiasm, and there were the usual queues for the toilets. The flight itself was uneventful and landing was more or less on time. CPT had an efficient arrangement for checking forms immediately after leaving the airbridge and there were no queues at immigration. It was good to be back!"
,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,London to Tampa,November 2021,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  I paid $1189 for a round trip flight to London and back in premium economy. They bumped me from the seat for the flight back, and told me I'd be issued a refund. Instead of being issued a refund I had to contact them through several different methods, phone, website, Twitter, and finally email. They told me I'd be getting $229.16 back, which is less than half of the $589 I paid for the upgrade. Instead they refunded $14.58. I emailed again and they told me I'd be getting $115.16 more back. When I emailed again saying that that doesn't add up to the original amount I was told I was getting they simply replied with ""That's the final amount."" Turns out that meant they were taking back the initial refund of $14.58 and I was only getting $115.16 total. So I emailed them again asking why they changed the amount and they've yet to respond. So I called this morning and after explaining politely what I was calling for they hung up on me."
A320-200,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Edinburgh to London,December 2021,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4,yes,,5.0,"✅ Trip Verified | Very nice return flight with BA. To add to my previous review, I really like how BA organises boarding and disembarking processes in groups, this is super comfortable as 100+ passengers don’t jump out and then sweat in a queue when the gate is not even there. The A320 was new and the cabin had a fresh feeling with nice mood lighting. Row 1 has an enhanced legroom and thus, makes the 1-hour hop very comfortable. Once again, amazing staff, and they were even more attentive and accommodating to Gold level passengers: always coming and asking if any help is needed. Lovely humus, beetroot and quinoa salad for food. Great WiFi at really competitive pricing + I think it is great that they also have food / alcohol offered to buy online for all travel classes. Domestic T5 arrivals is a breeze."
A320-200,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Edinburgh,December 2021,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4,yes,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall, a very lovely flight with BA to Edinburgh during Christmas holidays. Lounge was ok, quite worn out, although staff and food were nice (much better than when I travelled last time). Although the plane seemed old, the cabin felt very fresh, clean, temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking (around 22-23C) and Had a funky lighting. Although seats are the same as those in Economy, they are pretty comfortable for a 1-hour hop (much better than those at Air France) and together with an enhanced legroom in row 1 it was wonderful (for Gold card passengers, BA automatically reserves row 1 in Club Europe with enhanced legroom which I think is a great touch). The crew (especially the purser) were phenomenal: extremely friendly, adaptive to your needs and professional, leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste. Afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight: sandwiches and scones were tasty. I am actually a fan of well-presented, however simpler meals on board; to my opinion, they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust. For a quick hop, BA ticked all the marks here (in comparison, on a CDG-LHR leg Air France presented a ‘chic’ cold starter, however, to me, it looked a bit too complicated and, except from the duck terrine, rather unappetising / KLM served a super nice and simple Chicken Caesar but it was in a paper box). One big drawback was the First wing experience at T5: the queue there was so long that I decided to go through the regular lines instead. It’s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers / their companies spend to earn a Gold status. Nevertheless, the flight and, most importantly, the crew completely negated that drawback. The flight was £200 one way (£600 return incl. transfer to Kirkwall) which was pretty expensive, however, the service seemed like it was worth the money."

The boarding was appalling and had families with kids queue for no reason at all. They called families to the front but then decided to board business and premier classes first which I appreciate why but why call families? The worse seats ever and the legroom was appalling. The entertainment system is basic, it does not support Bluetooth headphones, the USB does not support your own devices for movies although the website says yes and the headphones input was as good as useless.  The crew were nice so sorry I missed that."

BA’s VeriFLY app worked perfectly and on-line check-in was seamless. The bags drop at T5 was seamless and boarding was done efficiently by zones. Although an older 777 it had been refurbished and everything was new and clean. The cabin crew were a credit to the airline – smartly dressed, friendly and keen to please. We were offered two drinks before lunch was served, with more drinks with the meal. The food was acceptable and we were given a tasty sandwich before landing. Obviously it was only economy but, after 8 hours flying, I arrived relaxed and unstressed."

T5 is a mess with 90 minute queue to check bags with tons of people arriving late. Check in guy seemed clueless about Turkey needs for pcr etc. BA lounge is a joke so i went out and got sushi from a restaurant - there was mulled wine in crowded lounge but just bad all round. Boarding was chaos and we left an hour late. A320 was jammed full but business class there is little legroom and just the middle seat free, you might as well fly a low cost carrier for same seat. There is no inflight screen no overhead screen. Although the curtain was closed economy people used the forward bathroom with no crew sending them back. The only salvation was a pretty decent shepherds pie and red wine otherwise I would avoid flying BA. The next day I flew the same aircraft type to Bahrain on another carrier with proper business class seat in flight screen, headphones, good food and drinks, Arabic coffee, dates and gracious service. BA hang your head in shame."

The privacy afforded is so much better, in-flight entertainment and storage were brilliant. Unfortunately, we had the most lethargic crew ever who once the meal was served basically disappeared. The wines were warm, they even forgot to offer my wife a drink with lunch, and she also had a pair of used socks in her storage cabinet. Heathrow was a nightmare as often happens. Being 5 minutes early was rewarded with a 40-minute wait for a gate, then a 2.5 hour wait for our luggage, absolutely shocking in Covid times."

Airport information kept telling passengers to go to gate for a further hour and a half before passengers learned the flight had been cancelled via the BA APP, we then had to join a line for the customer service desk, it took two hours to reach the desk in my case, on reaching the desk I was told I had automatically been booked on the following mornings flight and being offered overnight hotel. That did not meet my needs so I requested cancellation and to get my bags back, I was told to cancel my booking on the BA APP, they could not do it at the desk. I was then directed via a gate to collect my bags, this meant having to go via the UK border to reach a baggage belt, then I waited for my bags for 3 hours because they had automatically stored my bags for the following days flight. BA staff were rude and dismissive of customer complaints at length of time bags were taking to arrive, like it was our fault for cancelling the alternative flight they had offered the next day."
Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London Gatwick to Cancun,December 2021,1.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,3,no,2.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  It is first time we have flown BA business class in a 777 aircraft and hopefully it will be the last. Firstly, the check-in and crew were great - friendly and helpful. It was manual check-in, not a machine, which is always much nicer. No complaints at all in that department. Food on the journey was adequate but no choice of starter, or desert and 3 choices for main course, Business class seating is 2-4-2 with alternate seats facing backwards, as are both the centre seats. We were in those, so you are either facing a stranger on the aisle seat, or you put the screen up  and you are in a claustrophobic bubble. You cannot see out. You cannot see other passengers. It was slightly better as it was my wife and myself, but it would be utterly awful to be shut in this space with a stranger.  Nowhere to put a glass, bottle of water, book, or glasses within easy reach, unless you keep the table down. In most business class seats you can tuck your bag under the seat in front for take off and landing, but there is nowhere to put a bag, so everything has to go in the overhead locker, and they are missing over the first 4 rows of centre seats, so not much storage space. We were in row 1 and to get out you have to climb over the legs and leg rest of the person in the aisle seat in row 2. Now if you are travelling solo in the centre seats that is always the case, but normally if, as a couple, you take aisle and centre at least you are climbing over your partner's legs, not some stranger. I am 5ft 10 and could just about manage. My wife at 5ft 4 could not get over without disturbing the passenger in the row behind. The reading light was hopeless and did not shine on your book and the light controlled from the handset did not work at all. This is utterly awful design and will certainly make us avoid BA in future, if at all possible."

Furthermore, many people were not wearing masks and when I asked the flight attendants why they were allowing people not to wear the masks they said there are medical exceptions. When we ordered more drinks they replied that we needed to pick them out ourselves, what a business class customer service."

,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to London,July 2021,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,3.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had a future travel voucher for Singapore to London which I thought would be perfect for my flight to relocate home. I'd been under the impression that it was a simple process - just call up and book onto the same route that I'd previously paid for (and that had previously been cancelled by BA themselves) - but on a new date. How wrong I was. First, I had to pay to top up my flight - a significant amount, equivalent to around the value of my original flight which was a redemption ticket of part cash part airmiles. This was because of price increases and the fact that I was flying at peak times. The extra charge also meant that I overall paid more than face value (their online price at the time for the ticket) for the flight, as well as them still keeping the airlines I'd redeemed. They explained that the online price and redemption prices differ and that's just how the system works. However, if I had taken a refund I would have lost a lot of money to administration fees. They had me in a desperate situation where I was losing hundreds of pounds to them no matter what I did, so I cut my losses and booked the flight. Or at least I thought I did. The call centre agent - who had previously explained she was working remotely with no manager or supervision (and no way to escalate issues) - took my card details (including full card number, dates, and CVC code) - and explained my flight ticket and receipt for payment for an extra bag would follow. A week later, I still had no ticket, no details, no charge to my card, no booking reference - nothing. I called up to confirm. The call centre agent I reached apologised and advised he would escalate it to the bookings team and again took my card details. Once again, I waited another week, and sign of being booked onto a flight. Thus began a cycle of increasingly frequent and desperate calls to British Airways as they repeatedly failed to do the simple task of booking me on a flight, spanning over 6 weeks.  On the Friday before my Monday flight, I sat in tears to another BA call centre agent who promised to get me on my flight and book my extra bag. The next day - around 48 hours before I was due to fly, I finally got my booking reference yet they still failed to charge me for or add on my extra bag. Luckily, I noticed this on my check in details and managed to add a bag online. The whole experience was stressful, costly, and resulted in me spending hours and days on the phone listening to British Airways hold music. Furthermore, there has been a significant cutback to BAs inflight catering service due to COVID, resulting in smaller portions, leaving me quite hungry on such a long flight. Though I've flown BA repeatedly with few problems in the past, their service has gone significantly downhill."
,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cairo to Portland via London / Seattle,November 2021,,,,1.0,1,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  Extremely disappointed In trip experience. I am Gold MVP 100,000+ miler with Alaska Airlines. My ticket and travel wasnt linked with Alaska Airlines. When speaking with Alaska representative, they confirmed it was due to lack of effort on British Airways In accomplishing this task. I could over look the lack of effort on this even though frustrating. The Main issue is the ticketing and Flt connection process.  I departed Egypt this morning with connecting tickets in hand. Once I arrived in USA apparently my Alaska (AS 2449) flt was changed to a 5 hour later flight with a completely different airline (Delta). Who does that without notifying the customer. I found this out when trying to go through security In Seattle, they said my ticket was not valid. I had to go to Alaska Airline to find out What the issue was. They explained British Airways had rebooked with Delta. This took about 30mins with customer Service. Then i had to go to Delta to sort the mess out. I am so frustrated."
A320,Business,Business Class,London Heathrow to Paris CDG,November 2021,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways seems happy to encourage the spread of Covid. Took the 7am flight from T5 at Heathrow to Paris CDG on 22nd November, which was boarded by bus from a remote gate. The bus driver insisted on packing the bus to its maximum possible load, standing by the door and telling customers to squeeze right up and he was not leaving the terminal until the bus was full. The result was that passengers in the bus were packed tight and the maximum facial distancing was about 15cms! A second coach to the aircraft followed just a few minutes later and had about 15 customers on it. It is shameful that BA ground staff exercise no control and did nothing to check the bus boarding process, and whilst the flight was okay, this serves to underline how BA seem happy to disregard any Covid-19 safety protocols in the airport environment. In contrast, on recent Air France and Iberia flights, their ground staff are much more disciplined and actually try to control customers. Maybe this underlines the very laissez faire attitude to Covid that now prevails in the UK. "
,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dublin to Mauritius via London,February 2019,,,,,1,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  I purchased a ticket for Dublin to Mauritius on British Airways for 23 Feb 2019. On the day of travel, a few hours before the departure time, I realized that I would not be able to make it and so I got in touch with British Airways on Twitter advising them of my cancellation. When I arrived home, I asked them to officially cancel my ticket and issue me a refund. I understood that my ticket was a non-refundable one, but it says on the ticket that surcharges, taxes and airport fees would be refundable which should have amounted to at least 250 euro. However, all the airline  refunded me was a pitiful 50 euro. I have been trying to speak to British Airways on Twitter many times over the past few months, and they never responded positively, only insisting that they were doing the right thing and that their position would not change. British Airways is being dishonest and should be avoided."

The Concorde room in Heathrow Terminal 5 was amazing, the dinner experience was great and the food was delicious. However, the First galleries was overcrowded and the buffet was bad. On the plane, the crew was very friendly and nice. Dinner service was finished 1 hour after take off, the food was okay. Bed was made after dinner and it was very comfortable, perhaps the best I have had. The entertainment system was not as good as other airlines like Qatar Airlines and Emirates.

However, their customer service has fallen to such a level that I must say it is terrible. If you have no problems this is a good airline. If you have any problems you will not be able to get any help. I recently flew to London from Chicago. They erroneously cancelled my seats although I had checked in over 5 hours before he flight. They then downgraded my seat and put me on the plane. They then lost my luggage for 15 days. These things happen but customer service was impossible to use. When you call, you almost always get a message that says they are busy and the phone automatically hangs up. If you send in a request for help via the website you will get only a robo generated message that they will get back to you. They do not. You can't find out the status of your inquiry and only get a looping set of computer messages. Do not take this airline if customer service may be important to you."

It took me a while to write this review as I it took me a while to get over what happened to me. But I feel that the way British Airways behaved needs a review for their valiant efforts. Last year I went with my 9 year old son and my 80 year old friend to New Orleans from London on the holiday of a life time. I was pregnant at the time. The baby died while I was on holiday there and I was in a turmoil of emotions. Regardless I tried to make the holiday a positive experience for my son and friend and carried on, all the while just wanting to go home as treatment needed to take place in England. Somehow I missed the flight back. I have no excuse for this. When I realised I was in a complete state. I had a break down. I rang BA and sobbed down the phone. They were beyond amazing! They arranged a flight back home the same day without any extra cost. We all sat together and we were able to fly home that day and I was in hospital the day afterwards. Customer service was outstanding. So compassionate and helpful. And again they did not ask for a penny for our return flights. I am beyond grateful for their help. I will only ever fly BA on long haul if possible."

Everything about the customer service, customer relations has been terrible, hours of waiting on the phone, no answers on email. My other flights with BA this year has been delayed too. They have for two months promised to reimburse me on all my expenses and to pay the penalty fine of 700$. First 10 days, then 21 bank days and now we are way passed anything else that they have not transferred the money yet. So far nothing and the complaint has been turned over to CAA and the Danish Aviation Authority."
,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Hong Kong to Copenhagen via London ,August 2019,3.0,2.0,,1.0,2,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to Copenhagen via London. The whole experience is a nightmare to me and my wife. My wife lost her luggage ever since the first day of our journey on 1st August because our two pieces of luggage were left in Heathrow Airport by BA staff when we took the transit flight from the UK to Copenhagen. We went to Menzies in CPH and they filed a repor. We stated in the missing report that if the luggage was found, they should be sent to our air b&b house in Marstal in CPH on or before 3rd August or deliver to the hotel we stayed in CPH if they were found on 4th August. On 2nd August, we found that the updated status of our missing luggage in the BA website showed that one of our luggage was found while another one had a possible match. Therefore, we kept phoning and emailing Menzies staff to urge them to send the luggage to our house but they failed to do so. And the website status showed that we chose to pick up the luggage in the airport, which was not our preference but we failed to change the preference on the website as it was preset. The system even changed the latest delivery date to 3th August 2020 instead of 2019 and we could not correct it by ourselves! On 3rd August, Menzies staff still failed to deliver the luggage to us so we told them we decided to pick them up at the airport. Unfortunately, when we went to the CPH airport on the 4th August, they told us that they had already sent the 'found' luggage to the island in Marstal on 4th. Apparently they did not follow our instructions and sent it to the wrong place on the wrong date. They then asked us to find the other luggage that had been scanned with a possible match randomly in the trolleys outside their office. We did find the other one by ourselves in the airport, which they claimed had been sent to the island but they insisted that it was the possible match one! They were so incompetent and even asked us to complain to the BA to push them to find the baggage for us. We believe that the baggage was the one which was sent to the island but is still missing but the staff messed it up. We were so confused which bag was really missing. We finally decided to ask them to deliver the luggage in Marstal to the airport and send it to the UK address which was our next destination. When we came back to the hotel in the evening on the 4th, we phoned Menzies again and found out that our luggage in Marstal had been sent back to the airport at 8 pm on the 4th. Hence, we decided to pick it up by ourselves on the 5th August before we flew to the UK. However, when we came to the airport again, we couldn't find our luggage and the staff didn't explain why and just told us to leave. If the luggage was sent it to the airport on the 4th, how come it would disappear on the 5th? The staff just kept saying that they were busy and that no one had time to look for the baggage for us. This service was totally unacceptable. We spnet hours parking at the airport and found that we got nothing! You can't imagine how furious and frustrated we were! We are literally sick of phoning Menzies staff every day and not getting anywhere. Now that Menzies staff asked us to pressure BA to in turn pressure them to locate our luggage. That's how ridiculous things have been for us. We are sure that you could do something about it. My wife has lost all her personal belongings since day 1 of our trip."

This was a very similar experience outbound and inbound. I am sure the plane was the same. I am a gold card holder and until this moment have always chosen BA. I am seriously considering not doing this again. The 777-200 we flew in business was dirty and old. I flew my family of 5 business class but 2 of the 5 seats did not operate - no headphones socket jack that operated. The screens were from the ark. Crew as always excellent but BA should be ashamed that they charge business class rates for this experience. I was told by the crew that they would contact me to tell me what would be outcome of the issue. I have heard to date zip. At least it was better than last year flying into DC from London when the seat did not recline even with a manual adjuster. That time at least we received AVIOS. The customer service is increasingly low cost in feel.

Though you can not call the in flight service as luxurious compared to some airlines, it was quite pleasant. The food and drink selection was pretty basic. However the ground staff especially at the check in counter in DXB and lost & found at London heathrow were rude and very unhelpful. I forgot to collect my suit which I had handed to crew member at the time of boarding. Upon approaching the BA counter, the personnel were not willing to help or register a lost and found complain.  Neither any empathy nor any willingness to help."

Crew on board very friendly and helpful but at times struggled to provide full dinner service speedily. Food was excellent. Business Class cabin comfortable. Weather related delay and blocked arrival gate resulted in short connection time at LHR. To our great surprise British Airways waited for us at the exit of the plane and drove our family (7 people ranging from 3 to 62 years) from Terminal 5 to Terminal 3, escorted us through security and brought us to and even through our departure gate and onto our flight to Pisa. Without this transfer help we would have missed our connection. Flight to Pisa on time, good crew, good on board catering, arrived 15 minutes before the time."
A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Venice Marco Polo,August 2019,4.0,5.0,,4.0,4,yes,,4.0,"✅ Trip Verified | A very good service on board this flight with British Airways from LHR to VCE. Although the flight was about 30 minutes delayed due to an aircraft change from an Airbus A319 to and Airbus A320, we arrived only slightly behind the scheduled arrival time. The crew were welcoming and informative and the plane was very clean (probably because the plane was relatively new). The seat was not too bad either with quite good leg room. One small issue that I could raise is that there was no complimentary food and beverage on board, you had to pay or use Avios (it isn't that bad as it was only to Europe). An overall very good experience on board this flight."
,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Chicago to London,August 2019,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3,no,2.0,4.0,"✅ Trip Verified | This was the worst experience I have ever had flying. There was sufficient time in Chicago to transfer our bags from American Airlines. AA verified that they delivered the bags to BA but they were not on our flight when we reached London. The bags did not arrive and we spent two days in London without our bags. I left a earphone hard case on the plane, but your Lost and Found never answered to file a claim. Your website was horrible to use to file this claim and I have heard nothing. On the return flight from London to Newark, your baggage inspectors obviously opened my suitcase and never replaced the lock. With an experience like this on our first vacation to London, I would do everything to never fly British Airways again."

No entertainment onboard. It is a small plane for this duration. "
Boeing 777-200,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Gatwick to Orlando,July 2019,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4,yes,4.0,,Not Verified |  Gatwick to Orlando. Excellent customer service. On arriving at Gatwick airport and checking in I learn that my interpretation of the USA esta rules was wrong and that I would have to apply for a new esta valid for the duration of my trip. This took longer than it should have and BA kept check in open for my party and a member of their check in staff came and found Me in the terminal and got our bags checked in and our boarding passes and got us rushed down to our waiting aircraft. The aircraft was clean and despite my best efforts we left on time. During the flight drinks were served and two food services. Towards the end of the flight I developed a bad nose bleed the stewardess that attended me was very kind and caring. So despite my best attempts to be a bad passenger BA really came through for me. The return journey went without a hitch and BA's check in at Orlando was quick and easy.

The seats are aging and uncomfortable. The forward-backward configuration is the most stupid I have seen. The cabin had 8 seats to a row and about 100 people packed into a crowded and noisy cabin. To book a specific seat you have to pay extra or try your luck 24 hours ahead of the flight.

The flight was on time. The cabin crew was very kind and the flight was very pleasant. I also ordered a tomato mozzarella flatbread, and it was very delicious. The only problem was at Heathrow, because the gate bridge had a malfunction, so we had to wait for about an hour at the aircraft. But it is not an airliner mistake. After all I enjoyed the flight with British Airways."

Rude and incompetent Iberia ground staff in Malaga. BA sent warning of the 2 hour delay just before the late boarding began - sophisticated IT setup they have! Club Europe meal remains a big cutback from 2017 despite what BA claim. Cabin staff were bored from the start and despite 4 serving in Club cabin the service was very poor. Arrived Heathrow at 23.45 and then sat waiting 10 mins for ground staff to show up.  Simply appalling trip and truly ripped off.
,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Sydney to Singapore,August 2019,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1,no,3.0,1.0,✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Singapore. Extremely disappointed trip. They are unable to even track our checked baggage when we found it was missing on the baggage carousel. Our baggage should have been premium handled as we were at business class but what happened was they can’t even tell if the baggage was loaded or not at departure. Many important things are in the checked baggage and we’ll have further trip later on which affected us badly. No response so far and the hotline they provided is always engaged
,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Inverness,August 2019,2.0,3.0,,1.0,1,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Inverness. Having previously written a review about the shockingly appalling experience with BA so far this summer, I felt the need to update with a new review as the final flight home I was rebooked on - after short-notice cancellation, which I had to wait over a day for - was also  cancelled due to a fault with the aircraft. We were sat on the plane for over an hour whilst the crew were waiting to hear from ground crew what was happening and where to go. Eventually got off the plane to utter chaos - mixed messages being given by ground crew. Some people given details about rebooking, others given nothing. Some people were sent texts with rebooking options, others (including me) received nothing. Vouchers handed out for hotel accommodation and shuttle bus to and from the hotels - however some people were only given one bus voucher, meaning they had no means to return to the airport the next day! Some people rebooked on a flight in two days time and told they’d have to return to the airport the next morning anyway to get any further refreshment or accommodation vouchers. Utterly appalling. Now I’m hoping against hope I might make it home today, 3 days after setting off!"
,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Heathrow to Glasgow,August 2019,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,,,Not Verified |  Heathrow to Glasgow. Again flight is delayed. It’s easier to use the train than fly with BA the staff don’t even get embarrassed anymore and stand smiling offering apologies to the tired and weary customers. Trouble is there is no other operators and it a case of take it or leave it. Very tired and disappointed to be paying my hard earned salary for this terrible service.
,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Inverness to Vancouver via London,August 2019,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1.0,1.0,"✅ Trip Verified | A supremely awful experience from beginning to end. Flight to Vancouver delayed by 4 hours due to a plane defect that had been resolved the previous day but somehow no attempt made to make up the time in between. Only told once on board what the problem was. Delays at baggage reclaim meant I didn’t get out of Vancouver airport until after midnight (originally scheduled to arrive 6.55pm). This affected a camping trip, the booking for which could not be changed. Flight home marred by massive queues at baggage check in and on the plane, due to IT faults, none of which were communicated until we were seated on the plane and told they could not leave until passenger information could get through to the crew. Due to more IT faults the inflight entertainment was not working so nothing to watch for the 9 hour flight. Food was awful and we got a choice of one meal. Spent hours at Heathrow airport awaiting my flight home to Inverness only to be told by text one hour before departure that it was cancelled. Queued for hours to get some information from someone. They rebooked me on a flight for 26 hours later without checking this was ok - only discovered it was over a day later when I was handed my boarding pass. This means I’ve missed a trip with friends to the Edinburgh festival. Had to source my own hotel and food etc and reclaim on expenses - a lot of money coming out of my account whilst I wait for this. Now I’m seeing my rebooked flight is already delayed and was told by customer service that there’s no telling whether my bags will arrive with me - I have to wait at baggage reclaim and see! If they are not on the flight I have no information as to when I can expect to have my belongings back with me. These are merely the most significant issues, there were more and I’m really shocked at what a consistently terrible service has been provided. Between this, massive fines for data breaches and the fact that BA seem to have quite consistent and severe issues with IT, it is beyond my comprehension how they can still be in business."

,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Nice,August 2019,,,,1.0,1,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Nice. I agree totally with the comments made in Michael Croft's review today. My flight to Nice was cancelled as a result of the low-cost and unreliable IT system that BA have, while the senior management are likely celebrating somewhere that they managed to cut more costs. The handling of the situation at Heathrow was despicable, and you would think that with all the failures that BA encounter these days, they would have got this part of their act together. They make out such a problem is a bolt from the blue, when clearly they have not been investing where they should, instead focussing on cost cutting to boost their performance bonuses. Not just the CEO should go, but some others at the top."

How does British Airways get away with having such a useless IT system and presumably team of IT staff / management? These issues recur on such a frequent basis it is now time for some heads to roll, preferably from the CEO down. Just read a fatuously stupid interview with Alex Cruz talking about how his children are guiding him on the future of air travel, when this man cannot manage to run the airline properly in 2019 - let alone try to make himself look all eco-friendly with such comments. I have been a loyal customer for over 48 years, and it seems that BA have not the slightest interest in those of us that pay full fares and have been through all the lows of BA without complaint until now. My patience has run out. "

All the flights were cancelled without explanation - presumably because the striking staff didn't turn up, so trip was ruined. Got a replacement ticket for a different destination on a different week. Trip was basic. The meal consisted of two small shortbread biscuits. British Airways is now firmly in the bucket airlines, easily beaten by Easyjet"

Two weeks before the flight without any warnings and email from British Airways we've found out that our seats has been moved to ""unlucky"" 13 inbound and to a 8 outbound. They've split all family quite far away apart from each other as well. Customer Service has hang up on us for the first time, and second phone call has promised to call back but never did. Will I ever over pay (£2000 difference) so I can have ""Good customer Service with British Airways ever again? - the answer is no . I am extremely upset (that our seats has been given away to someone else for no reason), disappointed and you can no longer rely on British Airways."

After that, we went to buy a neck cushion and we went to put our make up in bags, show our passport and then go through to security. My daughter was beeped, but it wasn't a big deal. It was fast, and our flight was departing in 1h 30m. We got some drinks, and then we noticed our gate was announced early. We headed to the gate and boarding began about 20m later. Boarding was fast, and we were sitting in seats 33 DEF. The seats were comfortable, leather and had headrests. A321 so there was no IFE. We had a 1 hour delay from the bad airspace, but eventually took off. Our route was a little different, instead of going over France, Switzerland, etc, we went over Germany, Hungary, etc. The food was good and wasn't too expensive. We didn't buy anything really, just food. While coming into Bulgaria, the views were nice. The landing was pretty good, despite the bump. Eventually we got off 1 hour late, and we went home. The verdict is that British Airways are pretty good, despite the delay."

Boeing 777-300ER,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Hong Kong to London,July 2019,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3,yes,3.0,2.0,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to London Heathrow, this is a long haul flight operated by Boeing 777-300ER. The seat especially the headrest is quite comfortable. The legroom is large but there is a little metal box under the seat. This negatively affects the legroom. The films provided are not that many but I can see the flight path through the personal television. They provide dinner and breakfast for me. It is quite abundant but not very delicious."
,Business,Premium Economy,London Heathrow to Las Vegas,July 2019,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3,no,4.0,1.0,"✅ Trip Verified |  What happened to a great airline? Got to Heathrow 1.5 hours before flight and start queuing and at one point there were only 2 operators and then after 15 minutes a 3rd appeared. 45 minutes later a BA guy asks for Vegas travellers and then asks us to go toba different line to rush things through. There was 1 operator on this line and it took another 20 minutes? Waited over 1 hour on the tarmac as we has missed our slot due to late boarding. Got to Las Vegas and waited at baggage claim for over 40 minutes, no bag. Got to BA desk to be told luggage missed plane and there should have been 2 members of staff at bag claim to tell us. No apology just a shrug of shoulders. During day receive offers from BA to upgrade to Club class and I try at least 10 times to book but website does not process. Speak to BA at 1st offer to be told offer finished despite the web advertising, get through to Manager who admits the BA website is the worst and advises to keep trying. Book in online for return and web accepts the 2 bags stated on web as 0 bags. Ring BA and they say go to airport and speak to a member of staff. Get Vegas 3 hours early to make sure plenty of time to sort and find out there are NO BA staff available in the whole airport until 2 hours before flight. What a useless organisation. I must state staff on plane very good."
A320,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London Heathrow to Malaga,July 2019,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Malaga in business class. Full and very large Club Europe cabin on this morning flight. Held in the airbridge for 15 mins while boarding and not a word or reason as to why. On boarding, 2 cabin staff by entrance stood chatting amongst themselves and totally ignored customers - not a great start. Usual cabin service except the staff were not the slightest bit interested in customer service and having paid a premium for business class realised it was such a waste of money. The breakfast standards (full English) are about the same as a charter flight standard, and despite what BA shout about, this has gone through some considerable cost cutting. BA can perform well on a good day, but it seems that cabin service is getting less consistent by the day - are staff preparing to go on strike as well since that is the attitude they displayed. Male cabin staff was quite offensive to some Arabic customers in front, which was a shocker."

The 777 aircraft is looking old, the economy class seat is small and fairly cramped, the inflight entertainment is shown on small screens (films are OK, the music selection is dire and make sure you bring your own noise cancelling headphone) and the food is just OK. The flight did pretty much leave and arrive on time (allowing for the rerouting around Pakistani airspace). "

On 24th of July i arrived late just before departure time 1330hrs, the shuttle bus picked me late from my hotel. The British airways ladies who checked me advised me to rush because the plane was about to depart. I rushed through the security thereby leaving my back pack which had all my documents. When i was rushing back to the security i met the 2 lovely ladies who had checked me in and they asked me to go up with them to the plane because it was about to leave, i panicked and they assured me that i will get my back pack in Durban. As i sat down in the plane another British airways hostess came and reassured me that i will get all my bags in Durban. On my arrival in Durban i got all my bags including my back pack! I would like to say thank you to the British Airways staff especially the 2 lovely ladies who checked me in. Its a pity i didn't get their names i was panicky. Thank you so much!"

Boeing 737-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Johannesburg OR Tambo to Cape Town,July 2019,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,5.0,,"✅ Trip Verified | Johannesburg to Cape Town return. This flight was operated by Comair, and thus it was quite different from a normal British Airways flight in Europe. Check in at the priority line was uneventful, however on the return the guy at the counter did not know that Oneworld Sapphire could check in at the business class counter and kept on asking if I was flying business. Johannesburg airport and Cape Town's domestic terminal is laid out very similarly. Their lounge, called SLOW is actually impressive. Although there was no full english on offer unlike the British Airways Galleries lounges in other places, there was a substantial amount of savoury snacks, pastries and small bites. They even had a coffee counter with made-to-order drinks. I assume later in the day this also becomes a bar serving alcohol. Very impressive for a domestic business class lounge. Priority boarding was honoured, and boarding was an orderly process. I would recommend anybody wanting to get an extra legroom seat to reserve row 6, as there is actually tons of legroom in front. I reserved an exit row and paid an extra £7 per exit row during the booking. These seats were old and plush, however I do prefer the newer leather seat used on their European aircraft as those offer better support. I had also noticed during boarding that their business class had slightly larger seats, in a 2x3 configuration. I did not expect this as business class in Europe is normally just a blocked middle seat. There were several drink services on this two hour flight, and a hot breakfast with either a bacon, sausage and scrambled egg option or cheese omelette with vegetables option. Needless to say, a hot meal on a two hour flight is very appreciated. It was also rather tasty and tasted quite fresh. The crew were very friendly, making casual jokes and giving a down-to-earth friendliness you rarely get on airlines these days. They were quite rushed, but understandable due to the short flight time. In Cape Town airport, it was actually quite weird to see them use both an airbridge and stairs for passengers to deplane/board. But since it took only 15 minutes to board a rather full 737, it works and makes sense. I think that this flight has improved my opinion on British Airways, and they were the same price as the competition, South African Airways. I would be very curious on my next visit to see how the two of them compare, given the fact that both are giving a near homologous product on Africa's busiest air route. For the price paid, I'd be happy to fly them again."
Boeing 777-200,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Grenada to Gatwick,July 2019,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3,yes,5.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  Grenada to Gatwick. Having flown with BA on this aircraft type prior to refurbishment, I was intrigued to experience the changes to the cabin. The cabin was much smarter - previous aircraft have looked very tired and the lighting was pleasant. The entertainment system was hugely improved, with a good selection of media on larger touch screen devices. I suppose the reason I appreciated this was because the old systems were so hopelessly outdated! But the family really found them entertaining. For me the real issue was the tight leg room - I am a slim 6ft 2'' and now the lack of seat width made it almost impossible to eat a meal! It was for me very tight. Previously the seat format was 3-3-3. It is now 3-4-3. We were sat in the 4 outbound although on return, we sat near the back of economy where the aircraft narrows and seats become 2-4-2. We sat in a 2, which was more bearable. I also found the seat really hard after a couple of hours although sitting on the supplied back rest cushion helped a bit! Despite best efforts to sleep, I failed..... I remember the old seats being more comfortable, especially for long haul. Service was professional and timely and food was similar to previous flights - edible. In summary, it seems a shame that BA have improved some aspects of the experience, but seat comfort has been sacrificed, which is a great pity."

Lately I am frequently flying Premium Economy with British Airways. The extra comfort compared to Economy Class is unparalleled. The seat is way more comfortable, attendants are really professional and very friendly. If just could add the leg rest into all the other seats, and not just the first row (as it used to be in the old BA Premium Economy seats), then it would be perfect. That's my only note."
,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tel Aviv to Toronto via London,July 2019,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5,yes,4.0,,✅ Trip Verified |  Tel Aviv to Toronto via London. The plane from London to Toronto was run by Air Belgium The service from checkin until we received our cases here in Israel was excellent. The cabin staff on each airline were helpful and friendly. The food was all acceptable for economy airline food and we had snacks and on 1 flight icecream was served. Soft drinks as well as wine and alcohol was plentiful for the people that asked and water was served all during each flight. The planes had ample leg room and the seats were comfortable for economy class. Inflight entertainment was good enough there was something to watch on 4 flights. I haven't travelled British Airways for years but I will do again if the price is competitive as were these flights

I was sent to the wrong baggage drop, then to the wrong lounge, I showed my boarding card and sent to the north lounge the furthest from the gate. The boarding process was more like a rugby scrum, no notice was taken of class of service and then my boarding card said assistance required so another queue was needed no explanation was given for this."

The gate where the arriving plane was planned to stop was not free what occurred in a waiting time on the ground for 40 minutes. The captain constantly gave information and the entire team was friendly and courteous. Continental breakfast in business was OK for this short flight. Flight to Larnaca was full, embarkation was prompt for business pax. The team was very friendly. The service started with a drink and some cookies , the meal was good despite a more substantial appetiser could be expected - a few slices of green salad and one cherry tomato is a side dish not an appetiser. It must be said the meal was an improvement since last year. Decent drinks and a good Champagne were available, followed by coffee or tea. It is a longer flight - a second round of drinks an hour before landing was maybe appropriated however it was not a problem to receive additional drinks."

,Business,Business Class,Toronto to London,July 2019,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified | Seems like no one was aware of my existence on the flight. No drink, no snack, no bottle of water was offered. No amenity kits. When I asked, they said none were left in stock. They gave me toothpaste and a toothbrush, which was ok, and fast track invitation, which was useless, since no fast track is offered to British passports. I was not given a menu, I even had to ask for it. I was not served the meal and they said it was because I was sleeping. Ok fine but even when I was awake, no one bothered to ask me about the meal. I had to ask for the menu, a bottle of water, and the meal. And after all, no apologies from the staff. Too many people are squeezed into business class. Even though I could lie down 180 degrees, I had very little space at my seat. Given the very expensive fare, I expected a much better service for business class passengers. I'm very disappointed and will never use it again. I won't recommend British Airways business class to anyone!"
Boeing 737,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Orlando to London,July 2019,3.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,3,yes,3.0,1.0,"✅ Trip Verified | Premium economy don’t waste your money on an overnight flight! Going out is acceptable but the night flight we had was a disgrace! The food (I use this term lightly) wasn’t fit for dogs on our flight, it was salmon we think as it didn’t taste of anything, a meat of some kind but was too tough to stick a fork into let alone eat it. The veg tasted burnt, bread roll was ok. (Not really a saving grace). One cup of tea or coffee at breakfast and don’t bother asking what was in the box left on our table! I didn’t bother trying it. The look on other people’s faces was good enough for me to know don’t bother! Which in comparison to the outbound flight (London to Orlando) was worlds apart, greeted with a drink which was the first of many, dinner was nice, the steak edible, veg cooked just right and dessert was nice with plenty of drinks! Inflight entertainment was good even though there was supposed to be WiFi but couldn’t log on so saved some money there. I really thought this was going to be the best way to travel. Oh a broken seat for one of our party was a bit disappointing, homeward bound and the inflight entertainment seem rather lacklustre which leads me to think it was an older plane. But that really shouldn’t happen. What is not told when booking, homeward flight on the top of your ticket if you have TSA PRE you don’t have to join the massive queue, look for pre entered TSA line that’s the one that’s empty cause they tell no one about it."

When they bring the hot towel it feels like a bad joke. Seats are the same as coach, they took forever to hang my jacket after I asked in three occasions, they gave me a sit that is considered a bad coach seat without window! (See picture) and on top of everything I find myself having to put my luggage (just a backpack) far behind my seat because they are choosing to bring the extra hand luggage that doesn’t fit anymore in coach to business class. Ridiculous service so not worth the x2.5 cost that a business class ticket goes for. Feel totally ripped off."

Our flight arrived over 2 hours late at 8.50pm, so late our car rental company was closed and we were stuck at the airport without our car. We had to pay for a taxi to our hotel and back to the airport the next day which was really expensive. Our new car hire was three times the price since it was last minute. British Airways would not help compensate because they said it wasn’t their fault."
,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to London,July 2019,3.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,,,✅ Trip Verified |  Frankfurt to London. BA staff watched while security went through partner's bag for around 30 mins. It required a call to police who sauntered up and stared at the bag for a while - actually just clothes. When they were finishing the flight dispatcher closed the flight. Only 1-2 minutes required. Much longer spent unloading my luggage. We had checked this bag in almost 2 hours previously and arrived at security in plenty of time.

The plane was delayed getting to Sardinia, and so we waited: but following check-in at Sardinia we were penned into long lines, no seats, extreme heat and no water in the queues. The airport staff in Sardinia appeared to be overwhelmed. Finally got onto the plane and we’re now delayed on the tarmac. We are due to depart more than 3 hours after our scheduled departure time, but so far still stuck on the tarmac with few updates. No water provided. I felt unwell but was told they had no glasses, so nothing to drink. Numerous small children with no hydration and high temperatures. After a second time of asking, I was told I could buy a drink once we took off, but they have no idea when that would be. They need to abandon the flight at this stage before more people become unwell. Cabin crew just standing there, doing nothing but looking perplexed"

As I worried I wouldn’t make it, I asked to be put in a hotel & fly the following morning but they said that was not an option as all fights are booked. There was no apology, no offer of a bus or taxis to those re-routed to Amsterdam. And throughout the process & long queue no one bothered to explain to us what was happening. Had I known we’d be re-routed to Amsterdam I would’ve left Rotterdam earlier, rather than wait in a long queue just to he told that info at the end. What a waste of time, energy & money. And no apology to make up for the hours or delay. It’s quite unbelievable. "

We boarded a half full flight and whilst preparing for take off the video was shown as normal, the crew participation side of it seemed like trouble to the crew. Once inflight the drinks service got under way and service was very quick I had a beer and my partner a soft drink, I was given a room temperature can and no drinking vessel and my partner her soft drink and the standard plastic cup no mention of ice. Within 20 minutes the meal service commenced they got to our seats which were 3 from the back of the aircraft and when we were served two trays appeared and passed to us, I enquired what the meal was and we were both told Pasta it’s all we have left, everyone else had a choice of chicken or pasta, my partner refused her pasta and I proceeded to challenge why on a half filled flight they had run out, no tangible answer came back but was very rudely told she would get chicken from premium economy, I said only one was required as I would eat the pasta, glad I did I think, chicken was placed on my partners tray it was burnt. During this service no further drinks were offered except for water, trays were gathered and that was the last we saw of the crew for 4 hours. They reappeared about 70 minutes before landing served a box containing stale bread with processed cheese and a stale cake, I politely refused the offering and my partner ate the bread, tea and coffee was served.  Our flight out 7 days previously was the exact opposite, pleasant staff, food standard but acceptable. The only other negative was the musical chairs played by fellow passengers, the crew turned a blind eye. The positives the IFE has a wide choice and we got home safely and getting off the aircraft was a pleasure as it was also the coldest flights I have ever been on."

On this trip like the previous the plane broke down, and we waited 2.5 hours on the plane for it to be repaired whilst the temperature outside was 42 degrees. The cabin crew director offered passengers the opportunity to purchase water and other cold drinks from the bar. Only BA could try to make money out of one of its technical failures. I then waited another hour to pick up my suitcase. As I'm a silver card holder, I could access their business lounge in Madrid. I regret using it. Fortunately, this was my last ever trip on BA."

A routine and smooth overnight flight that departed the gate about 45 minutes late because of a security issue at the terminal (#7). I had an electronic boarding pass on the BA app but an announcement was made that we needed to get paper versions. There was a separate desk where a couple of agents performed this task. The pilot introduced the flight attendants as “gorgeous” - which came across to me as inappropriate. I would have preferred efficient or even helpful to describe them. I had an aisle seat in a 3-3-3 seat layout. The middle seat was unoccupied. Enough leg space and storage space overhead. A good collection of all sorts of movies with free headphones provided. The IFE system was easy to use. A drink service preceded the meal service. I asked for a beer and was cheerfully offered their centenary year specially brewed IPA Brewdog Speedbird 100. Sensing that I might not enjoy it, the attendant also gave me a Heineken and a bottle of wine to accompany the dinner that followed soon thereafter. The entree choices were chicken and pasta. I chose the later. Very basic food. Tea and coffee followed. Before landing a sandwich and a drink was served. I could not figure out what was in the sandwich! The bathroom was clean. Blankets and pillows were on every seat. Alighting was quick. Landing cards have been done away with. For the fare, I paid I was satisfied - no complaints. I connected to a domestic flight to Glasgow. The announcement of the gate was made quite late. Newspapers were available at the gate - a worthy amenity. It was a smooth flight in a 3-3 seating. I was in an aisle seat, the next to me was empty. No complimentary food or drink on this segment. The two flight attendants, once the plane reached cruising altitude, put on aprons and pushed a cart down the aisle hawking edibles and elixirs. The pilot introduced them as gorgeous. Both on this and the earlier flight, a video presentation showed off the safety instructions. It was supposed to be funny and engaging. I felt it was neither - the accents of the actors were hard to understand. The flight landed on time. Overall, a positive experience but next time I will look into a non-stop flight to Glasgow from New York. The transfer at Heathrow is anxiety-inducing."

We would definitely fly again with BA, and are planning on making this our only airline if it flies to all of my destinations. On departure my TV did not work they tried twice to reset it for me, however this did not work. That was fine I resolved to reading my book. Just before landing our flight attendant who had be looking after us, asked if it had been rectified, I replied, no but it was ok. She came back with a bottle of Champagne, a pair of Pyjamas and a makeup bag full of goodies, not just for me but for my sister as well!! To say I was overwhelmed was an understatement! All I can say is Thank you British Airways from the bottom of my heart! The trip was for my Birthday and you certainly made it something special!"

Duvet and bedding much better and what you expect for this high-cost route, the Pillow is fabulous, gone are the small pillows and we now have a luxurious pillow you want to use. 10/10 for this flight and the crew, even though it was full up front, I hope this is a turning point for British Airways. Thank you I am looking forward to my Seychelles flight in October and my Rio flight in December, keep it coming."

The early morning departure meant that Terminal 5 was unusually quiet. The Galleries Lounge offered a wide range of food and drinks in a pleasant environment. The flight took off and landed on time. The cabin crew were incredibly attentive and provided a very professional and pleasant onboard experience. Arrival procedures at Larnaca were incredibly efficient. We completed immigration and picked up our hold baggage within 30 minutes of arriving at the gate. All in all a very enjoyable trip.

Both flights on a Saturday and were full. Aircraft was an A320-200 on both legs. Sat in row 7 outbound, 2 rows behind Club Europe. Sat in row 25 on the return, leg room seemed tighter than row 7. The brown leather seating suggested that the aircraft may have been in the BMI Fleet. Didn’t bother with the new M&S On Board service outward, but did on the return. The M&S sandwich was everything you would expect from an M&S sandwich (apart from the cost), but the coffee I had and the tea my wife had were below standard. It also took the 2 cabin crew the best part of 75 minutes to get from row 6 to row 25. The other 2 members of the cabin crew appeared to hide in Club Europe attending to just 10 passengers. Despite quite a lot of turbulence and the Seat Belt sign on for about 30 minutes, they continued to serve hot drinks and passengers were advised to be careful. You are now given a cup of hot water to add your coffee or tea bag to. Also a queue of 7 or 8 passengers requiring the toilet also formed behind the trolley, and they would not return to their seats. The rubbish from the trolley service was collected by hand as we were preparing to land. Outbound flight was fine, Inbound flight was not a great advertisement for BA. Perhaps standards at LGW are not as good as at LHR."

Used Avios points to upgrade to exit row seats for more legroom. Bad news - took off 1 1/2 hours late from Heathrow (delays to previous incoming flight) but made up about 1/2 hour on the journey out. Also left Kalamata about 1/2 hour late on our return but landed virtually on time. Seats much more comfortable with more padding than, for example, Ryanair or Jet2.com so with the extra legroom, the flights were pretty comfortable. Expensive (or course) M&S offerings for food but tasty enough. Pleasant FA's so all in all decent flights. Haven't used BA for short haul for quite a few years but would use again if the price was right."

She replied yes but you were the last person, everyone had made it before me, my bags were already offloaded she continued to say.  After asking what do I do now?

I wanted to reserve seats and request special meals. It took me 2 days to achive this. I was amazed by the cost of reserving ordinary seats, no extra legroom, this bumped the price up for 4 people by £328 and seats were only booked on the LHR-KUL and return KUL-LHR legs. I had difficulty checking in using the BA app and eventually did it using Malaysia Airlines app. Checking in online was only allowed 24hrs before making things a little awkward being in Kuching for our return leg with an 8 hr time difference. I was looking forward to flying on the Boeing 787 but it really is just a dream. Food choices we were told ran out at breakfast, the choice was full English or just an omelette, but the full English ran out or so we were told, but looking over my shoulder a few minutes later and another trolley had appeared with the full English on it. Earlier meals were ok with beer, wine and other drinks available. There was very little attention by cabin crew between main meals and we had to go to the rear galley to ask for water. For an over 12h flight, I think the cabin should at least be visited 2-3 times. Toilets were clean and worked ok and the aircraft as a whole was clean and tidy. The IFE selection was superb with many of the latest films available along with games and music. Our return flight from KL to London was very cold, the Boeing 787 has no way of changing the airflow to your seat."

I then  asked for a bottle of water  which she seemed to forget.  2 hours into the  journey, my in-flight entertainment system got stuck on the TV and Radio feature. When the dinner was served, Ithe meal consisted of chicken gravy and mash, along with bread butter and a mousse.

Check-in was fairly smooth at Belfast as it was early in the morning. However, when the agent called me over the check me in, he was all flustered that I wasn't an elite Executive Club member although my boyfriend had just checked in with the same agent without any difficulty. I knew he was working the premium line, but nobody was standing in it, and I was standing in the regular line when he called me. After about 20 minutes, I finally got a boarding pass to go through security. The flight from BHD to LHR was uneventful and bare-bones, as nothing was served for free on the flight. My boyfriend therefore hated it, as we're used to getting better service on American in the US, but I was fully aware that BA had turned itself into a glorified EasyJet. Once we arrived to LHR, I continued by myself to Atlanta on BA and was shocked at the crowded, user-unfriendly T5. Although I suppose it was pretty in some ways, I had to sit in one of the dank cattle pits they hold people in until their flight is called, so it felt very crowded and hot. After my flight was called, I found myself on a crowded shuttle to the plane with pushy people. Boarding was straightforward, however, and the flight attendants were very polite and helpful to customers, even in economy. The flight product was just OK in my view. I had an exit row aisle seat, and while I had extra room and a nice headrest, the seat was right by the lav, so it stank. IFE was fine with a decent selection, but it was not as complete as Delta's. The food was the bland equivalent of what Delta serves, so no brownie points there, and the ""tea"" service they had was terrible: we were given half-sandwiches in plastic wrap without a tray and then only with a limited selection of beverages. I remember years ago when BA was a premium carrier and served very nice things to its passengers with a friendly smile. Those smiles have disappeared for the most part, and the feeling of flying a special carrier is no longer there. However, I arrived on time and promptly got my bag. The 777 was also nice and spacious and the flight attendants were polite, so I might fly them again, though I would not recommend BA due to the crowds and discomfort I experienced at T5."

Despite looking forward to flying on this new route to Nashville, British Airways ruined this trip. The flight was delayed by over three hours, whilst they ostensibly replaced the damaged aircraft with an inbound Boeing 787-9 from San Jose. The airplane was filthy dirty in Club Class, which is bad enough having to suffer the awful, dated, Club Class ying-yang facing, narrow seats with divider. Business Class on British Airways is the worst of any airline. The WIFI was out of service. On late arrival in Nashville, my luggage arrived soaking wet, and I was unable to change clothes. On my return to the UK, I contacted British Airways Customer Relations to seek compensation, and got the usual pathetic, mainly computer generated, insincere apology. I am now forced to haggle with British Airways, and endure their woeful so-called Customer Relations department. It is a real shame to witness the decline of this national carrier. British Airways treat their premium class customers with contempt. This is what happens when an airline has a monopoly from Heathrow. "

,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newcastle to Berlin via London,June 2019,3.0,3.0,,1.0,1,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified | Just checked in for a flight from Newcastle with BA. The check in process was disgusting. 45 minutes queuing. 2 BA staff working in two desks, one of which was a virtually empty priority queue in which the female checking assistant spent a large proportion of her time chatting to a colleague from Air France in the adjacent desk! The process was ridiculously slow with each check in taking several minutes. When the priority queue representative deigned to check economy passengers, she seemed to take an eternity. In the 45 minutes it took us, the queue never dropped below about 100 people. I have never queued in a slower or more disorganised check in desk. The adjacent Jet2 desks had seven staffed desks and I counted 14 staff! The “welcome” sign displayed at the BA desk should have been located at the start of the queue with the additional wording of “you’re in for a long wait”. To cap it all, after enduring the queue, we’re now delayed 40 minutes thus far! So unprofessional!"

The representative said she’d make sure the suitcase was delivered by 5.00 p.m. I was out during the day. When I returned later that evening there was no suitcase. It hadn’t been delivered. The next morning (Sunday) I phoned the number again. The answer message said phone back on Monday. As I was leaving on Sunday night this was pointless. I was leaving Madrid at 8.30 pm. My one suitcase arrived two hours before I left Madrid. So I spent the whole time in Madrid without my medicines, change of clothes, toiletries etc which ended up wasting a lot of my (short, valuable) time buying essentials that I needed whilst there."

I was told that the penalty fee for changing the flight is $275 each and there’s a $50 fee for them to do it over the phone that’s $600, and the price of a flight by itself. We decided to try our luck again changing it on the app and paid $550 to change our flight to one day earlier to make it back for an event. The flight was delayed and arrived 1hr 55 mins late. We missed our event. The plane was filthy and my tv didn’t work. I asked the flight attendant for something to clean the slimy finger smears off the screen with and she told me it’s normal wear and tear but I could get toilet paper from the bathroom. I called to ask for a refund for the fees since the flight was delayed but they told me they can’t give us a refund because we got on the flight."

When I asked the flight attendant to help me with this, he asked me to keep my luggage down.  I was travelling with only one laptop bag, placed it in the cabin right over my seat and instead of asking the oversized bag to be placed properly or kept it elsewhere, my bag which was in place before the oversized bag came in was asked to be moved out.

I am a frequent flyer with BA and have not always had an amazing experience, this one was. Check in was easy and swift and the Concorde Room was excellent. The flight itself was wonderful, while I accept it isn’t the best first class cabin in the skies the service is second to none. The cabin crew were friendly greeting us by name and showing us personally to our seats. Throughout they ensured we were very well looked after without them being overbearing. New soft product is very good and food definitely much improved. "

Unfortunately I was taken ill on this flight and the service went from good to superb! I’d like to thank the cabin crew and Captain for the care I received during the last two hours of the flight. Advice was sought via radio, I was made comfortable in the galley, at least one crew member with me at all times, given oxygen etc. paramedic boarded the plane and escorted me off when I was then given a thorough medical check, a wheel chair was waiting and we were fast tracked through customs as I was not well enough to walk to the car park.

Firstly one cannot make one booking for two passengers if only one has luggage. This caused an issue when trying to seat together. When the passenger without luggage tried to move seats (normally a free option for standard seats), you get advised that you have to pay. This was not disclosed when the booking was made.

A319/A320,Business,Economy Class,London to Milan,May 2019,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,3,yes,,,✅ Trip Verified |  London to Milan. Evening outbound flight with some on board space so middle seat was empty. Boarding by group number worked effectively and I was able to store my laptop in the overhead. Free newspapers were available in the jet way. Passengers were warmly greeted. I was one row behind emergency exit and despite numerous requests from the steward woman in front was very challenging in agreeing to have her bag stored in the overhead which the steward handled very politely and patiently. Usual on board trolley service which I didn't use. Flight departed 10 minutes late due to lengthy taxi way and due to a head wind arrived in Linate 20 minutes late. Return flight could have been a challenge due to Italian strike but the very full flight departed on time and landed 15 minutes early. The cabin crew on this flight were excellent especially the senior stewardess who was warm and friendly towards every single customer - outstanding. We were taken off the aircraft and bussed into T5 which I think actually saved time as the entrance is directly below passport control. All in all a couple of very good flights.
B737-400 / A380 / A319,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Durban to Leeds via Johannesburg / Heathrow,May 2019,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,5.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  The connecting flight to Johannesburg was on an older 737-400 with proper business class seats and lots of legroom. Pre-take off drinks offered and a decent meal for a short flight. Everything went smoothly and service was good. Boarding for the main flight was on time and proceeded smoothly, we were seated on the upper deck in the forward cabin. Much has been said about the BA ying-yang seat configuration. The seats are narrow, and there is a lack of privacy for the aisle seat, with probably the main complaint being lack of storage for personal items around the seat. However the seat is very comfortable in any position, and the White Company bedding is excellent. We had an aisle / centre seats at the rear of the cabin, which worked well as a couple with the privacy screen left down. The centre seat does have a shelf for personal belongings, and access from this seat does not require stepping over another passenger. The service on this flight was superb, from the welcome on boarding and continuing throughout the flight - very efficient, quick to respond, and super friendly. Preflight champagne or fruit juice was offered as soon as we were seated, with a bar service as soon as the seat belt light was off. There was a choice of 4 starters, 3 mains, and 3 sweets or cheeseboard, with a decent choice of wines. Breakfast offered a good choice, although we were happy with just the fruit, yoghurt, and bread. There could be no complaints in respect of catering. The A380 is a super aircraft and very quiet, but without doubt the major feature of this flight was the fantastic crew. Our connecting flight to Leeds was good, but compared with our South African flight it was noticeable that this was economy class seats and spacing with just an empty middle seat. It is a short flight, but there was still a full meal service. The only poor aspect on this trip was arrival in Leeds. The airport seems quite run-down, escalator not working, and few staff to be seen. There was only one other arrival, but we still waited over 30 minutes for luggage to come through."
Boeing 787,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London Heathrow to Los Angeles,May 2019,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4,yes,5.0,,"✅ Trip Verified | London Heathrow to Los Angeles. Very nice experience. I read other reviews slamming BA but that was not the experience we had. From the check in to the lounge and on board the flight our experience was fantastic. Crew on the flight was outstanding and very attentive. Food was good, not great, but very good. Seats worked well and comfy (more on that in the seat review). Again, the flight crew and make or break the experience and this crew hit a home run. In flight entertainment worked well but was not streaming with I like over the monitors. AA does a very good job on this One World route as well but I would take BA over AA if you can but both airlines do a good job on these longer hauls."
Boeing 744,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Cape Town to London Heathrow,May 2019,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3,yes,3.0,,"✅ Trip Verified | CPT is definitely getting its act together: BA's Galleries Lounge is spacious with a good selection of food and staff actually managed to make the group boarding work for once. The upper deck is still one of the better bets when flying in Club World. That's despite the ancient yin/yang seats and the tiny IFE screen with appalling resolution. The new bedding certainly helps cushion the hard seats and the large pillow actually feels luxurious. The dinner service was according to the new CW 'soft' design, which meant delays while plates were brought out to passengers individually. On the whole, I think it works and having the 'triple bread' roll already on the tray means that the bread is there when you want it, rather than served with the dessert. Breakfast has been streamlined, too, and staff actually paid attention to the request cards filled in before takeoff. Apart from some inevitable turbulence, the flight went according to plan and we touched down 30 minutes ahead of schedule. A good flight, overall, but an old style business class experience."

I am not tall, but my knees were pushing against the seat in front.  Service was non existent unless you want to pay inflated prices. Where did the service go? There was a bad delay on the Belfast flight.  We were not allowed to re-enter the lounge when the plane developed a fault, as we had gone through security.  Only after 40 minutes were we allowed to re-enter the lounge. Service announcement was chaotic and contradicted what BA was sending us via texts. The delay lasted 2 hours 55 minutes, just short enough to avoid compensation. The Belfast flight had a lot more legroom than the 3-hour flight from Sofia.  I will never set foot on this airline again. "

,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Heathrow to Singapore,May 2019,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3,no,4.0,,"✅ Trip Verified | I was seated right next to the galley and lavatory in the aisle. During the safety talk the cabin crew were only metres away talking loudly which was irritating, so my initial impression was disappointed for business class. However, into the flight I found one female crew very personable and was offered a seat two back. I was not provided with a complimentary travel wallet, so did not realise that socks and sleep mask were available, and I needed to ask for a pillow. The menu guide was on cheap paper and, with no convenient place to store it for reference later, was very ordinary. The evening meal was acceptable (soup, steak/veg, fruits ) was OK served with freezing cold cutlery. Bed was ok but nowhere to store spectacles or personal needs such as spectacles, asthma puffer, or water bottle. The breakfast of juice and cereal/yoghurt was fine but the single poached egg was like a rubber ball and the included fish patties were unpalatable. The lavatory was spacious and allowed room to change clothes ready for the connecting flight. Overall I expected a better level of attention to detail and a more upmarket delivery. The only business class addition feature that I appreciated was being able to stretch out for some sleep. BA ground staff were unable to link my second flight on a QF 11 from Singapore to Brisbane, insisting I needed to collect my luggage, leave arrivals and recheck in for next flight. I am 73 with some mobility problems, requiring assistance, so this was a worry for me. When I arrived in Singapore, the kind assistance girl arranged to take me to a special transit desk where it was no problem arranging for my bags to be forwarded to next flight."

Boeing 777-200,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Gatwick to Barbados,May 2019,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3,no,4.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  
Gatwick to Barbados return. I normally travel on BA with low expectations with the result that I am not too disappointed and sometimes pleasantly surprised. The outbound flight was about par for the course with a reasonably comfortable seat and an OK cabin crew that did just about enough to look after us and make the flight uneventful. However, the flight did leave bang on time and managed to land in Barbados before the Virgin flight that was scheduled to leave Gatwick five minutes before us, with the result that we got through arrivals quickly. The return flight a week later managed to reinforce my low expectations of BA with one of the poorer flights that we have experienced over the last few years. Once again when you travel west to east, the crew (specifically one lady who was looking after our part of the cabin) somehow feel they have to rush through every part of the drinks and meal service that it becomes an ordeal. The pre departure drinks were missed on all of seats on the left hand side of the PE cabin (not a big deal but irritating non the less). No bread was served with dinner, despite there being butter on the plate, so I presume it was missed. My wife had ordered a veggie meal and was served about ten minutes before everyone else, which was fine. However, as the crew were serving the remaining meals, there was a continual dialogue across the two aisles about what selections they each had on their respective trolleys. When they reached our row, they somehow thought it would be a good idea to try and pass a hot tray of chicken in gravy across the four middle seats with the result that the red hot gravy spilled on the my wife's remaining food and lap, although fortunately she did have a napkin in place which absorbed most of the liquid. It also spilled on my Kindle which thankfully had the cover closed. A very brief apology was given but without any sincerity and I suspect blissfully unaware of the obvious mistake they had made. My wife's wine was replaced but not the rest of her dinner. Once again we landed on time, which was a good thing. Overall, the return flight was extremely poor."
,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Marseille to London,May 2019,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  Marseille to London. I am generally annoyed with the quality of the service. I believe that we should not have to pay for a glass of water with slice of lemon in a BA flight. I realised that I forgot a big duty free bag in the plane after the passport control. I went to the BA Helpdesk, the staff sent me to terminal 5 at the lost and found to pick up my bag while it was not even there. Luckily, I decided to stop on the way in the lost and found of terminal 3, where they (the friendly lost and found staff and not the BA staff) nicely explained me that there was no point for me to go there and called some other agents to help me.

A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Gatwick to Malaga,May 2019,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5,yes,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Malaga. Check in was fairly quick. The check in area at Gatwick is quite nice although they are failing with general upkeep. The whole area needed vacuuming and there were stains and signs of chewing gum on the carpets. If you’re not going to look after it then you better just having normal airport flooring. The lounge at Gatwick is really nice and whilst it was very busy, there were still available comfy and desk style chairs to suit. The food and drink offering was very good. Tasty and varied. On board I was lucky to be able to book the exit row, which actually makes the seats better than club in my opinion. Food and drinks service was fairly slow although being near the front this wasn’t a problem for me. The food offering is fairly poor really, a couple of sandwiches or snacks.. drinks selection is better. What was very nice was, near the end of the flight I was given a free glass of champagne for being a silver member. I wouldn’t expect this, and I’m sure it’s just because they had a bottle to use up, but it was a nice gesture to show to frequent flyers. Still no WiFi or WiFi based in flight entertainment offered. Priority bag tags as usual are kind of irrelevant. My bag took quite a long time to come through and was preceded by dozens of non priority bags. Overall a decent flight, and very good value as I paid using avios. Being silver and getting lounge access and free seat selection was a massive plus."
A380 / Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to London Heathrow,May 2019,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4,yes,3.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  Boston to London Heathrow, was excited to experience A380 for the first time. Paid a steep $91 for the seat selection on the upper deck. Was very comfortable with storage cabin beneath the Window. Seat itself was the standard one, comfortable. The boarding was efficiently managed for such a large aircraft. There was never a massive crowd in front of the gate. The inflight service for the outbound leg was less than ideal. The food was very mediocre at best - not worth losing sleep over it. There was serious bumps along the way midflight. The A380 being so massive easily absorbed it. Return was on a B777 - flight was not full but almost full. The inflight service and the food served were both remarkably better than the outbound journey. The baggage drop area however was a disaster. None of the machines worked and there was single kind hearted person assisting passengers. The boarding was again very orderly. Both outbound and inbound IFE was good but not as good as some long haul carriers. If both legs had similar cabin crew and food I would have scored them higher. "
Boeing 747-400,Couple Leisure,First Class,London to Cape Town,May 2019,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3,yes,3.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Cape Town in First and our first taste of the new 'soft' product. Still, unfortunately, a 30 year-old 747 that hadn't had its refurbishment and was showing its age. A wardrobe door that's falling off its hinges, a non-touch touch screen and a cupboard door in the washroom that won't stay shut don't pass muster in First and blemish the impression of the positive changes in the on-board service. The young mixed fleet crew did a reasonable job and served drinks and food efficiently without the wait other reviewers have complained about. Care was also taken in preparing and plating up the food. For once, nothing was overcooked and even the beef was decent. Bedding is also improved, with a good quality duvet and large pillow. The IFE remains the same low-res screen quality and the new headphones are uncomfortable worn for more than the duration of a single film. The goodies bag is much better and worth taking home. Overall, a pretty good flight, but it remains to be seen what BA will do with its long-in-the-tooth First Class when their new Club Suites are launched."
,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Heathrow ,May 2019,3.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,3,yes,5.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  This review is specifically aimed at the excellent cabin crew on BA 174 from JFK New York to Heathrow on Tue 14th May. I was travelling back from New York following a few days break with 11 girlfriends. Check in and boarding was all on schedule,however it was identified that there was a technical problem and the captain advised passengers that some assistance was required to rectify the issue; this resulted in over an hour's delay leaving NY. Despite this annoying delay, the cabin crew more than made up for this. They were friendly, polite and couldn't do enough to ensure our journey was comfortable and enjoyable, they were all exceptional, even those that were not serving in the section I was in. I do hope that this information is passed on."
A321,Business,Economy Class,London to Aberdeen,May 2019,2.0,2.0,,1.0,1,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Aberdeen. Before boarding the flight I was forced to check in my bag at the gate because apparently the flight was full and I was boarding in Group 5. I was traveling with the permitted allowance and discussed with the lady at the Boarding Gate. I saw people boarding with Tax free bags on top of the other bags. Being almost the last on the plane, there was free spaces to accommodate bags. I was not happy because I had the permitted allowance. "

,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,London to Shanghai,March 2019,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  I paid an extra £500 for two Premium economy seats on this long haul flight and was very disappointed. The seat felt small and was shabby, the tv screen was small and very dark. I tried to adjust it but it was still unwatchable. The whole experience was very poor, not Premium in any way. The return flight was a code share with Japan Airines which was Premium, a whole different experience. I would be happy to pay for their Premium seats. I would advise avoid British Airways Premium economy as it is far from Premium. I felt a complete waste of £500."
A320,Business,Business Class,Faro to Heathrow,May 2019,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2,no,,,✅ Trip Verified |  Faro to Heathrow. Flight was very good no issues at all but yet again baggage collection was a disaster. We fly club or first all the time and without fail the baggage is always last off. Spoke to BA desk and they were clueless and had no idea why this happens or how to stop it and correct it. Same happened on flight out too. It is a shambles and a disgrace. Waited 39 mins got cases at Heathrow and this is unacceptable will kit be using them again. Avoid at all costs.
A380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to London,May 2019,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4,yes,3.0,4.0,"✅ Trip Verified | Vancouver to London. An excellent flight on BA. I travel this route several times a year and generally BA are much better than AC, Especially on this flight, BA were way ahead of the competition. Seats comfortable, food pretty good for economy, decent wine and the in flight crew, simply outstanding. Professional, smiling, friendly. They embodied BA at their very best."
,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Gatwick to Tenerife,May 2019,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Tenerife. All so wrong. Lounge really overcrowded / food on the plane pretty horrid, left most of it. Paid for and travelling Business Class and allocated four rows away from my partner,  this is normal procedure. Apparently on top of a £2000 six night holiday I should have paid another hundred pounds plus to sit with my partner - total madness. This is an airline with a self destruct button, such a shame.Have just booked Norwegian for our next flights to Barcelona and Buenos Aires, did not even bother to look at BA."
Boeing 747 400,Business,First Class,Washington to London,May 2019,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4,yes,4.0,1.0,"✅ Trip Verified | Washington to London. Having travelled out to Washington from Heathrow on 23/04/19 First Class I wasn't overly impressed. Although the Concorde Room was relaxing and comfortable, the bar staff were a mixture of attentive and somewhat dismissive. The cabin crew were polite but quite surgical in their manner which gave an overall impression of a cold and clinical approach. My return journey couldn't have been more different. The BA lounge was very well presented with a fantastic choice of both food and drink but the hi-light of my return flight were the engaging nature of the cabin crew. Nothing short of amazing. I was offered the usual amenities upon boarding but what set this flight apart from the start was the very happy and friendly nature of the crew. Absolutely nothing was too much trouble and they took the time to chat with me and showed a real general interest in what we talked about. Demeanour was perfect with both a very professional yet relaxing and engaging approach. A fantastic sense of humour and seemed genuinely delighted to assist. Having had mixed levels of service with BA and always flying Virgin I think BA need to track down this staff member and use her as the model for all future cabin crew training."
Embraer,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Rome Fiumicino to London City,May 2019,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,,,"✅ Trip Verified | Rome Fiumicino to London City. A BA Cityflyer service. No wait to check in. Aircraft was not full. We pushed back early and arrived early. This route still has complimentary refreshments in economy, including wine – a great bonus and pleasant surprise. Cabin service was pleasant and professional. A really excellent flight."
Boeing 777-200,Business,Business Class,London to Shanghai,April 2019,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2,no,1.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Shanghai. The most disappointing business class I have flown in a long time. The plane was old, worn and dirty (there were crumbs of food on the seat and the floor from a previous flight), It took 2 hours to for drinks service to reach my seat after take off - the food followed shortly, which was over cooked. They seemed to be short on staff. However, what made me really angry was that there were people in the cabin who had had both drinks and food and were having their beds turned down before I’d even been offered a drink. The service was exceptionally poor. I am flying home tomorrow and am not looking forward to the flight. As a Gold card holder, you might have thought BA would check their frequent fliers are being looked after? I’ll return to using other airlines in the one world group for my long haul trips, such as Cathay, JAL or Finnair. The only reason that I’ve given more than one star is that I managed to sleep quite well - the bedding and pillows were good. Ultimately though - sorry BA, not good enough."
,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to London,May 2019,3.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1,no,2.0,,"✅ Trip Verified | Their customer service is horrible. Lost our bags. Here we sit in London after 2.5 days of wearing the same clothing. We fly out in 3 hours to Barcelona for a 14 day cruise and have pretty much lost any hope of being reunited with our bags before we go. I spent so much $$$ on this trip to celebrate my husbands 60th birthday and our 5th wedding anniversary. It was supposed to be our trip of a lifetime. We have really been trying to make light of things, but not getting our bags today, as it's now Friday and we left on Tuesday AM from Seattle, is heartbreaking. Not one single person at British Airways has handled this with any kind of urgency or empathy, for that matter. One customer service agent even asked me if we would be OK getting out to Heathrow to ""pick them up."" Truly the worst customer experience I've had."
,Business,Economy Class,London City to Zurich,April 2019,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5,yes,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  London City to Zurich, I fly this route a lot, around 8 times per year, The flight was delayed initially by an hour, I was kept up to date via the app so I was not disappointed. Around 45 minutes into the flight one of the crew member came over with a card in his hands wishing me a Happy Birthday followed by a bottle of Champagne, Brandy etc, this was totally unexpected, it made my day. Thanks to the crew."
,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bucharest to London,April 2019,3.0,3.0,,1.0,1,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked a flight from Bucharest to London and return and when we were at the airport, they informed us that the flight will be delayed for 5 hours (from 8am to 1pm), then another 1 hour and a half (until 2:30 pm). We lost the money we paid for the bus tickets and they would not refund. Returning to Bucharest our flight was delayed and they did not  inform us about it. I understand that unforeseen situation can happen, but I have never seen such a poorly prepared company in my life."

Miami to London Heathrow with British Airways. Top deck of 747 with one experienced and one new crew members.

,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to London Heathrow,April 2019,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  Houston to London. The plane left an hour late while an engineer dealt with a problem. I’ve no problem with that, I like travelling safely. I thought, well I’m sure I’d booked an aisle seat online but it appears it was a window. I missed out on the airline meal and when I realised I buzzed the steward and requested a sandwich and water, explaining the problem. He fetched me a sandwich and various bits he’d scrabbled together from the kitchen. Later when the liquid refreshment cane round, both my neighbour and I requested water and I had to reach across him for my drink as he helped himself to his drink and left me to it."
,Business,Business Class,London to Delhi,April 2019,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2,no,2.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Delhi. The worst business class trip for us. Seats much smaller than business class on Singapore Air, Thai International, Eva Air, Qantas; Not seated together - same surname, Mr and Mrs - but moved after. No privacy on middle seats; one tiny drawer is only storage for shoes, iPad, makeup and sponge bag, book etc. Film/TV selection was very limited and my choice wasn’t working. The food was very poor - main course congealed and so basic with a dessert that was pathetic, no tea, coffee, or chocolates offered to us. Breakfast had no jam with the croissant. Nobody came round during the flight offering extra water or other beverages. The crew didn’t put themselves out. If one pays more for business class one expects more and we didn’t get it. I would never choose to travel BA again."
,Business,Economy Class,Bucharest to London,April 2019,2.0,2.0,,1.0,1,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bucharest to London. My flight with British Airways was 7 hours delayed (from a European destination to London). I applied for compensation for this delay. Initially I was informed that under EU regulations I would receive 400 Euros compensation, to be informed 4 days later that this was an error and that I was no longer getting compensated. British Airways argued that sickness of a crew member is considered extraordinary circumstances (comparable with weather issues) and that therefore, they do not have to compensate passengers for this flight. However, there are court precedence cases that clearly show that crew sickness is not to be considered an extraordinary circumstance and that it is in an airlines responsibility to have a contingency strategy for such cases or compensate if they do not. I have talked to the manager of customer service and was told that there is nothing they can do as this is their policy. I believe that, if not on legal basis, British Airways should have compensated out of customer service reasons because a 7 hour delay (within Europe) is significant. Many times I picked to fly with British Airways based on the expectations of good customer service in the case of anything going wrong. But this experience proved to me that it's not worth investing that extra money into flying with British Airways."
Boeing 777-200/300,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Bengaluru,April 2019,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5,yes,2.0,,✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Bengaluru. I found the crew very friendly and even humorous! Whenever the airhostesses passed through the aisle (I was on a seat next to the aisle) we would exchange some friendly comments which almost always lead to muffled laughs!  One air hostess admitted that she enjoyed such conversations which made the stress of her work lighter! 
,Business,Business Class,Madrid to London,April 2019,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,,,"Not Verified |  Madrid to London. We paid for business class and then paid for specific seats. The original booking was from Iberia (part of IAG which operates BA, Iberia and Air lingus) BA clearly do not integrate into Iberia's systems since after paying for and closing our seats, upon checking in we found our seats had been changed by BA (these flights were operated by Iberia and BA, BA being the return leg from Madrid to London Heathrow). BA explained that they would have to check if we were due a refund - total joke since we paid for the seats. Additionally the BA said the flight was full and could not change the seats. No explanation as to why we paid for specific seats in business and they were changed by BA without notice. We'll accept the refund on this occasion since there is nothing else we can do and never use BA or Iberia again which is a shame since Iberia CS has always reflected all and IAG / BA has let the customer down, again. Just simply poor BA  and low bar as always, expected more for full fare business class. Rated 1/10 since as we were let down and did not receive an explanation and were initially told that we would not get a refund on the paid for allocated seats!"
A319,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dublin to London Heathrow,April 2019,4.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,3,yes,,,✅ Trip Verified |  Dublin to London Heathrow. British Airways offered a very good overall service on this flight. I booked online and found that process very easy. The caveat was not being able to select the seat I wanted ahead of travel without paying another fee. The check-in lady was very friendly and helpful and gave a good account of herself. The flight departed on-time and the captain made frequent announcements. Within the previous two weeks I had flown with BA twice within Europe and this flight was by the best of the 3 thanks to the staff. The flight was relatively short but well managed with a nice drop down map and staff visibly make a real effort. One curiosity was the staff handing out UK landing cards The flight was punctual and reliable.
Boeing 747-400,Business,Business Class,London to Seattle,April 2019,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2,no,3.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Seattle. My seat was on the upper deck, a nice perk for Seattle flights to Europe (BA is the only one flying 747s to Europe from Seattle). Overall the product is outdated. Service was not at the level it used to be. Staff is polite and professional but they keep the service to a minimum.  Upper deck crew on this flight was mainly uninterested except the bare minimum.  No additional service, no top ups, not offering water during the flight. Of course if you ask for something you do get it. There was also a lot of traffic on the stairway connecting upper and lower deck with the crew congregating at the lower deck.  I hope BA will improve their act. I certainly won’t use their services in foreseeable future."

Boeing 787-9,Family Leisure,Business Class,London to Doha,April 2019,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4,yes,1.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Doha. Similar to our outbound flight, the seats are comfortable but behind the competition, very small storage area , if you are tall try sleeping sitting up or in the cradle position as the bed is just not long enough. The food portions seems like you are forced to go on a diet, though the taste was ok. The entertainment system had the worst selection of any airline I have flown lately - but their check in baggage policy makes them a very attractive option when you see what their opposition charges for excess luggage."
Boeing 747,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Houston,April 2019,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4,yes,4.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Houston. Despite sitting at the back of the plane we were really well looked after. Without exception all of the staff in this cabin were exceptionally friendly and professional. They really seemed to be enjoying their work. Lunch and a pre landing snack were provide together with an ice cream mid flight. Commendably, even in these days of austerity, my pre lunch gin was served with Fever Tree tonic. Well done BA. Frequent drinks runs were made. Despite its age the Jumbo was well turned out internally. The only downside was because of Air Traffic issues at Heathrow the flight arrived late. This meant that we almost missed our connecting domestic flight. This was mainly down to tardy Immigration procedures, the need to pick up our bags and transfer to another terminal for our ongoing flight. All very stressful."
A320,Business,Business Class,Larnaca to London,March 2019,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1,no,,,Not Verified |  Larnaca to London. This A320 is totally unsuitable for a flight of this length. The seat pitch and width are the same for economy and club. Having paid €1000 for my flight it's disgraceful on flight where you are sitting for more than 5 hours in an expensive Club Europe seat the personal space is so tight. If the person in front reclined their seat it's a nightmare. The seat in the middle is blocked but getting out if the seats in front are reclined is hazardous.  You pay for a Club ticket for space and comfort and get nothing. 
,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Zurich to London,April 2019,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked my BA flight from Zurich to London Heathrow using Avios, my frequent flyer number had to be added 3 times during the booking process. When I tried to reserve an aisle seat (for medical reasons) the BA website showed that all of the seats had been allocated save for a few seats for which I would have had to pay about thirty pounds. The check-in area for BA at Zurich airport is in a hard to find spot of the airport. The check-in agent was very professional, helpful and informative. The area of departure from Zurich was by transfer train. The flight boarded in an orderly manner and left more or less on time. I was dismayed to see cabin crew serve alcohol to a group of already drunk German speaking sports fans. One of the cabin crew declared that she had run out of beer and then suggested to an increasingly loud and aggressive man that he might like the cider instead. In the meantime the same crew members ignored me and other passengers while offering the trolley service. The overhead maps were not used and the captain made minimal announcements during the flight none of which were in German. The flight arrived reasonably promptly."
,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Pisa,April 2019,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3,yes,,,✅ Trip Verified |  The booking process was easy enough but they have reduced the baggage allowance in terms of the seats one can book. The cost of including a bag added considerably to the cheapest fare. Check-in was well managed and it was good to see passengers with too much luggage required to check their bags in. Departure was well managed and although there was a delay the captain communicated well. My gripe is that my seat was dirty and the window was also dirty.  Some of the to buy M&S food items were not available and the lavatory I used was dirty. The staff were very professional and pleasant and the drop-down route map was nice especially for the younger passengers to enjoy. Hardworking crew.

,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Bridgetown to Gatwick,March 2019,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bridgetown to London Gatwick. Paid for a Business Class flight. The onboard service was abysmal. No refreshments offered on boarding. Dinner took three hours to be served (on a night flight). My Husband had to go to the Galley twice for his dinner requests, he’d been forgotten. I requested ‘Express’ service, which didn’t happen. Website advertises ‘Premium Levels of Service’ and ‘Every Journey Unique and Unforgettable.’ The service was dreadful, but the journey was definitely unforgettable for the wrong reasons. Don’t waste your money with this airline, you don’t get what you pay for and they try to compensate by offering loyalty points, and telling you that you don’t pay for the Service, that the extra costs are for taxes, the Lounge and extra loyalty points. All BA could respond with was a goodwill gesture of loyalty points. Really?"
777,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,St Lucia to Gatwick,April 2019,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  St Lucia to Gatwick on which my wife and I were both involuntarily downgraded from Premium Economy to Economy due overbooking on the flight. It should be noted that at no time was there any announcement for volunteers for downgrading at Vieux Fort Airport. I now know from your cabin crew that it is normal practice for appeals for volunteers to be put over the tannoy system before any enforced downgrades. At the time of going through the baggage hall getting our boarding passes we queried them as none had seat numbers on them to which we were told to just to go through security and our seats would be allocated when we went through the departure gate. Once in the departure lounge all four of us were tannoyed to return to the baggage hall when we were then told that my wife and I were being downgraded to economy. The male telling us this more or less indicated this was the only way we would be getting on the flight giving us £75 per each on a prepayment card as compensation under Article 7.3 of EC 261/2004 stating however that this did not affect our statutory rights. He then told us he would find us in the departure lounge and then all four of us had to go through security once again. The male who we spoke to in the baggage hall did not come and find us, we had to go and find him when he also told me that he had put my wife and I on a row with no other passengers which we assumed, rightly or wrongly, was so we could not tell people sitting beside us about the poor service we had received from BA. However two other passengers did come and sit beside us with the passenger sitting beside my wife telling her this was because the seat they had been allocated was soaking wet and smelt of urine and the cabin crew had asked them to sit on it with a cushion which they had refused and so they were given the seats next to us which was no problem. What further concerned me even more was one of your cabin crew walking past another passenger with their seat in the reclined position on three separate occasions just prior to approaching Gatwick and after the Pilot had requested seat belts on and seats in upright positions, never telling the passenger to raise their seat. BA’s latest advert celebrates 100 years of BA but for me their service is going backwards. The music that accompanies the advert is called ‘Salvation’ and by the end of the flight my wife and I were surely seeking it. Article 10 of EC Regulation 261/2004 is worth reading if this happens to you."
A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to London,April 2019,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to London. Cancelled flights just a few hours before I left home, then put me on a different flight which would have made it impossible to make my connecting flight. Was finally put on a different flight. On the way home, because my first flight was through American Airlines, and the second through British Airways (all in the same booking), I was only able to check in and get a seat on the American Airlines flight, as I was redirected every time to their website. Couldn’t check in for the British Airways flight so had to have a middle seat which is very uncomfortable. I always check in 24 hours before to guarantee a seat, but BA wouldn’t allow me to do this."

Not sufficient for a child also.  British Airways is sad in every sense of the term.

The 1.5h flight from Hamburg to Heathrow was like flying a budget carrier. No free service at all, everything has to be purchased at inflated prices. Heathrow T5 the usual chaos. I can use the F Lounge due to my One World status. Massive lounge, crowded with the charm and food quality of a Cafeteria. Toilets filthy. One of the worst lounges I’ve seen. Boarding orderly and well organized. Boeing 788 IFE screen broken. Seats very uncomfortable and narrow. Service and food quality average. Flight Abu Dhabi to Heathrow delayed by almost an hour due to late arrival of the flight crew, this is something I have never experieinced before. Rest of the journey uneventful. Overall a rather disappointing experience. BA cannot compete with the Middle Eastern carriers."

I don’t believe most airlines would have accepted my reasoning, however it’s great to see BA treat their customers with care."

This is the first time using BA since October 2002, nothing has changed,  the same reversible business class seats with very little storage space still comfortable but the business has caught up with BA and left them behind, with very poor entertainment selection and limited food choice. It cannot compare with other business leaders like Cathay and Qatar Airways but on this route BA charges the same price as Qatar Airways but delivers a much poorer product, though the service was OK not as personal but alright. Where they are better is with their check in luggage policy of 2 bags 32 kgs each they are superior and generous. I will still use them but look forward to them rolling in the new business class."

Food not great but on a par with economy in other airlines. Wines better than many airlines. The aircraft was clean and reasonably well maintained for an older 747-400. IFE selection good."

This First does not compare well with that of Middle Eastern and Asian airlines, but BA business class is so poor, I either fly economy or (when I am very lucky) try to fly First."

I had requested a special meal but that was not available. When I complained to customer relations they simply said too bad and insulted me by offering 10 K miles. The bathroom lacked amenities and i found the service was barebones. The angled suite is not private and when i stretched my feet hit a metal band in the middle of the foot rest. Video screen is small and must be stowed away 20 min before landing. Cabin crew never asked what I wanted and were only available when you press the call button. In flight entertainment is poor.

Customer services handling of my question never answered it. Three times I asked them to explain why the cost of my one checked bag caused the fare to increase over £100 on the outbound flight. This was before any increase other than the increase announced for the short LBA LHR fare. I asked why the fare was so much when I could have booked a seat for the bag for about £50. The response was we are doing what everyone else is doing. They never could explain why the fare increased by over £100 when I indicated one checked bag. I asked to speak with someone but that was never responded to. Book LHR LAS at that time and one bag included. Customer service apparently did not understand what I was asking because the answer provided was non-responsive.

This is the worst experience I have had on a flight. The crew was indifferent and unresponsive, and treated you more like you were a nuisance to them. There was even less service from this so called first class crew than you get in tourist class in most airlines. The attitude and service of the crew was abysmal. When you have average food and wine on offer and a rather outdated cabin in first class, at least you should prioritize service as your competitive advantage to your full paying customers. This was nothing but a waste of money. I doubt very much I will go back to British Airways again."
,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tenerife to Heathrow,March 2019,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  Tenerife to Heathrow. Effectively a budget airline masquerading at premium airline prices. Have flown several budget airlines in the past which have offered far more in terms of value for money and service. Seats are rigid and I felt as if I was leaning forward for the the majority of the flight. When I tried to put my seat back to recline, I estimate it moved around 5 degrees. Leg room is also non existent. M&S food ran out halfway through the 5 hour flight and although cabin crew were apologetic, for food to run out during a lunchtime flight is inexcusable and highlights how badly the airline is being managed by the upper echelons. Furthermore, several other budget airlines at the airport had flights leaving directly from the terminal requiring no bussing of passengers. BA again in a move to save money opt for bussing passengers to the far reaches of the airport to avoid paying extra charges for utilising direct access from airport terminals. Can't fault the staff onboard who are clearly dedicated to the BA brand. They are professional, friendly and courteous. It's clear that British Airways are not the airline they once were and I hope that passengers begin to vote with their feet as drastic changes are needed to bring the airline back to its former glory."

M&S food available to passengers ran out while cabin crew were half way down the aisle. Larnaca to Heathrow - two messages received while in Larnaca airport - the flight would be delayed by over an hour-departure was supposed to be at 7.15 pm but we took off nearer to 9 pm. The second message was that there was no food to be served on the flight, ""we recognise that this does not meet with the standards you expect from us"". The flight was 5 hours long-so this combination of a delayed departure and no food available on board is totally unacceptable - worse than a budget airline. A midnight arrival at Heathrow was then compounded by off loading cargo before the passengers because of a ""balance problem"". In addition I was incorrectly charged Eur 75 on the return leg for my case - it was clearly the same case that I travlled out to Cyprus with but the system identified it as extra baggage. Cattle class is an under rated description of the service offered to customers. The only saving grace was the cabin crew-particularly the Customer Service Manager-who promised to follow up the baggage issue and logged my complaint. It will take ages to resolve but he was helpful and pleasant throughout. How British Airways can offer such a poor product and expect people to keep flying with them is beyond me."

A very enjoyable and comfortable flight on the new recliner seat set up on the 787. BA have raised their game and provides a superior seat to make for a relaxed flight . If you are travelling solo a retractable divider gives you privacy from your neighbour. Only problem is the 2x3x2 layout is one too many seats across, as it leaves two very narrow gangways; if you have an aisle seat in the ""turn right"" section in Business Class you will be constantly whacked unintentionally(?) by Economy section passengers with their carry-ons when boarding. Food and drinks were excellent, with courses served separately and the wine bottle frequently produced by flight attendants who gave a great service to their passengers. Entertainment choice also excellent with a film choice for everyone. Thanks also to two people most of us forget - the flight crew who got us safely to Heathrow 15 minutes early and put the plane down so gently we hardly noticed we had arrived! Well done BA for providing such a good product and service."

However, it landed at 1940. Because of this I missed my connecting flight to Ontario, California aboard American Airlines. By the time I was able to go through custom and pick up my luggage, it was already 2030. The flight departs at 2037. I went to the ground crew of American Airlines, they told me that I will not be able to make it to my connecting flight as they are already on the runway. They then directed me to British Airways. I went to the ground attendant of British Airways and she told me to go back to American Airlines to get it re booked. I went back to American Airlines then they told me again to back to British Airways since they are they the one who caused the delay. I went back to British Airways with the American Airlines supervisor. The British Airways attendant gave me a card with the customer service number and told me to call them in the morning. She did not offer any explanations or anything. American Airlines said we can re booked it for tomorrow morning but they did not offer any accommodation. I ended up getting my own car rental and drove from Phoenix to California in the middle of the night since I was not able to resolve this issues with both airlines."

The online website is very clear and easy to use. Check-in procedure was smooth. The gate was very close to the shopping area.

The only negative aspect is that you will need to pay for a drink, as they don’t serve anything free on all European routes."

The bar is very well stocked and also a good selection of soft drinks available. I'm very happy with the airline service and would definitely recommend British Airways. Keep it up guys."
Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Gatwick to St Lucia,February 2019,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1,no,1.0,1.0,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to St Lucia return. Recently returned from a two week holiday with my wife in Caribbean for a 60th birthday celebration. Tickets bought in August 2018 and decided to spoil ourselves with a Club Class return, having flown out Premium Economy. Arrived at airport to be told that we'd been downgraded to Premium Economy due to overbooking. Apologetic ground staff (defending the indefensible) but no apology on the plane. Fuming all the way back to London, exacerbated by hopeless cabin staff service (tea when I asked for coffee) and filthy food. Complained on return through BA exec Club webiste with response from Customer Service 10 days later. BA claims that overbooking is a very rare occurrence and gave a lukewarm apology. Evidence from ground staff on both journeys contradicts this and it seems to be a standard occurrence during peak season. We booked early so probably had relatively cheap seats. BA has presumably made money by selling our tickets to a higher bidder. General quality of BA service, food and wine has fallen dramatically over the last few years. BA is now effectively a low cost airline, flying a fleet of very tired aircraft, trying to preserve the gloss of a quality airline. The accountants may win in the short term but passengers will vote with their feet. Avoid this airline if you possible can. And the final insult in booking premium seats with BA is that you get charge £40 to pre reserve in Club and £70 in Premium Economy. BA, you are having a laugh with the flying public. On this performance you don't deserve to stay in business."
Boeing 777,Business,Economy Class,London to Austin,February 2019,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4,yes,4.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  It's been many years since I flew long haul British Airways and I was pleasantly surprised by recent flights. BA staff used to be offhand and inhospitable but that's all changed. From the time of arriving at London Heathrow T5 the staff have been really friendly and helpful. Similarly on the flight, the attendants couldn't do enough for me. When I requested tomato juice with Worcester sauce, the attendant made a special trip to the rear to get it. On the way back I asked for a tonic water and, again, they offered to go and get it. The seating of these newer planes allows me knee room, even though I'm 6ft 3ins and the headrest can be slid up high enough too. The entertainment system, though a little quirky in its operation and menu system compared to the slickness of Cathay Pacific, nevertheless had a good range of movies and TV to watch. Both flights ended up arriving on time, despite delays at Heathrow both ways, and the pilots kept us cheerfully informed as what was going on. Food quality was reasonable, again not up to the standard of Cathay Pacific, rather let down by a filled croissant for breakfast which I thought was a bit mean. Overall a very pleasant flight, thanks BA. Is this because competition is hotting up and BA now have to try harder?"
A320,Family Leisure,Business Class,London to Pisa,March 2019,1.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,1,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified | 
London Heathrow / Pisa return. My wife and I fly this route 3-4 times a year as we have a home in Tuscany. Sometimes we pay in long advance to get a decent price, or we pay using Avios. This return trip was the latter. It is what it is. The most miserable rip off for a business class seat in the world. I have seen last minute flights on this route as high as £700 return. BA should be ashamed of themselves. The only reason we fly this product is that you get the business class lounges in both directions. The seating is at the front of the plane for a speedy exit. The new meals are quite good and the free (is it really free?) booze. The seats are the biggest con. Three seats for two - with a dumb table in the middle. Unless you are in the front row the leg room is a disaster. On the way out we had a nice tomato and mozzarella salad + wine. On the way back - a ploughman's lunch, it was okay-ish. As a 60 year old businessman, one who has worked globally in my career in the US, Japan and the Middle East - and having sold my business a few years ago, to one of the largest PLCs in the country - I think I know a bit about running companies. I know I could do a lot better than the current board at BA. Last week when I was away, I read that BA have posted well in excess of one billion profits last year. Oh, what a surprise and that's the clear objective of the directors. So what would I do with Club Europe? I'd make it the best in Europe. The seat would be larger, like an arm chair. A 2+2 configuration. There would be a nice centre table. Charge ports for phones/laptops. Headsets. TV screens mainly for news - but some movies for flights over 2 hours. Extra 6"" of leg room behind row ""1"". Nice cutlery and glass/china ware. Hot meals. And i'd probably sell it at £25 a flight more. ""Build value guys"" and the profits will follow. Its the oldest dictum in the book. I will give credit where credit is due. On the way back, on the ground, the Captain announced there was possible a technical problem with the starboard aileron. As an aviation buff I loseley understood the problem and figured it was not really a big deal. Clearly some passengers were worried we were on a duff plane. He picked up on that and took the initiative to take a relaxed walk, the length of plane, asking if anyone had concerns or questions. One or two did and he answered their concerns in a calm and thoughtful way and explained he was only taking a precautionary measure. Very nice chap. We took off 2 hours later when it was fixed and everything was fine. FAs in both directions were very good."

If these were cars they would have an antique plate. The seats are uncomfortable and worn. There is no lumbar support. The space between the seatback in front and your face is inches. It’s really claustrophobic. The food is awful and last evening we were not offered a choice. So for $1200 each we had horrible seats and terrible food. The short connecting flights do not even offer bottled water. The M&S menu is expensive and offers limited choices. Meal deals in the airport convenience and drug stores offer much better options for less than half the price. The planes on both long legs of the trip last week were filthy. The cabin crew on the BOS to LHR and LHR to EDI were good. There was one member in the LHR to BOS who was snippy to passengers and seemed put out by needing to do her job. Boarding is supposed to be by group but was a disaster as people queued up well before their section was called and it made it extremely difficult to get to board. British Airways has become like a budget airline who does not charge budget pricing.

My wife and 2 friends booked and paid £56 each to select our seats with additional legroom adjacent to the bassinet stowage. On boarding the flight the configuration of the aircraft differed, meaning we had the same seat row and number but without the additional legroom. My formal complaint to BA has been met with what can only be described as condescending platitudes and a blank refusal to refund our seat booking fee. We feel that this a scam and are continuing to pursue the matter. Trading standards are also being informed. It didn’t help the aircraft was delayed by 4 hours on the outward leg, was filthy dirty. The return flight had numerous IFE defects and my seat recline did not work. I also noted a number of cabin minor airworthiness issues, (I am a licensed engineer). A marketing email in celebration of 100 years of service has thanked me for flying hundreds of thousands of miles with BA and then rips me off with nothing in return. British Airways you are a disgrace, get your act together and provide the service you were once famed for."

I am only 5'2"" 8st 10 and I find the leg room too cramp. The onboard flight entertainment system was down on the BA flight most of the time. It was probably in the last 2 hours of the flight before they managed to fix it and the system was old fashioned and movies were streamed on a loop. The food was barely edible. Coming back on Iberia the entertainment system was better and the food was also better but the seats legroom was just as bad. I was almost bumped off my connecting flight at MAD due to the lockers being filled up. I had another connection to make at LHR and I was not going to miss that so I had to insist they let me on though loads of other passengers were led off. This was the worst flight I have flown on.

Didn’t wake me for breakfast, not sure why they had me fill in a form for when I wanted to be woken up. No instructions for the transition between BA flights.

Club Class on British Airways is without doubt the worst in the airline industry.  It is bad enough that BA persist using out of date airplanes, circa 25 year old B747-400's, but they perpetuate the dreadful ying/yang seating arrangement of Club Class, where you have to look directly at the passenger next to you, and raise a screen for privacy. Then, mid-flight the crew lower the screen to serve the food. To leave the seat, one has to climb over the legs of a sleeping passenger;~no mean feat in the dark. The crew from Chicago were appalling, and dumped the food upon us as quickly as possible. Breakfast was inedible, and I returned it uneaten. The lounge at O'Hare was a crowded, tiny, dirty facility, with a food bar including some wilted vegetables and crackers with cheese. Insufficient chairs, and a single, old TV. Does no one at BA care how BAD they have become for premium class passengers."

The flight to Chicago was equipped with the usual ancient Boeing 747-400. The British Airways First Class product doesn't come up to modern Business Class standards. This particular flight was late again, and the food / wine was simply awful. There is nothing remotely elegant about BA First Class, and the crew demonstrate no sophistication. This experience was like dining at your worst restaurant chain. Finally, not only is the aircraft tired and worn out, but the in flight so-called entertainment system did not work, and had to be rebooted twice. The First Class seat is a bad joke, and extraordinarily uncomfortable. British Airways are at least twenty years out of date with their entire First Class product. All that can be said about this airline is woeful. The Concorde First Class lounge at Heathrow is filthy dirty, and desperately needs refurbishment."

She told me that this was a late evening departure (9pm is not late for me) and that no pre-dinner drinks would be served. I insisted (this is business class after all, half full flight). 30 minutes later, she brought a tray with everything on it (G&T, first dish, main dish, and dessert).

Crew uniform still looks a bit tatty compared with rivals in this part of the world. There is good and bad still with BA - bad was the so called chicken wrap served just before arrival - leathery and inedible - why do they let themselves down with such a poor offering - hardly any passengers near me could eat it. Bad was that there was an old tissue and food wrapper in my seat pocket. Good was the newer aircraft and the breakfast has improved. Arrived on time at Heathrow but to a remote stand."

At Miami airport on October 2018 what a pleasure was dealing with the agent, so professional, nice and helpful to the every last detail. Now on February 2019 calling British Airways to redeem my Avios what another pleasure dealing with a patient, knowledgeable and nice agent. She explained everything in such detail. You are doing great with such fantastic employees. "
Boeing 787-9,Business,Premium Economy,London to Seoul,February 2019,5.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4,yes,3.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Seoul. I normally fly business but this was a last minute flight and the cost of Club was prohibitive and so I thought I would give World Traveller Plus a go. The cabin is stylish and intimate and I was surprised how roomy and comfortable the seats were. The entertainment system was working well (although the adverts before every single showing are very annoying). I was happy with the headphones and small amenity kit and felt the staff were very welcoming. My only complaint was the slightly pointless menu we were given as for lunch neither of the meals listed were actually available. A similar thing happened with breakfast, three options, the third being the most appetizing, and no, it hadn't been loaded, so this is an area BA might want to look into. All in all the service was good and worth the price. For ground service BA, please at least keep a couple of desks for people to check into before automation puts us all out of work."

Lounge (galleries north ) was good and not crowded. Boarding was fine, small delay, well organised. Pre take off drink was better than the one i got in club world 2 weeks previous. Main meal good, pre flight snack was average but my son really liked it. On time arrival, a good flight. Cabin crew included some of the older staff who are not mixed fleet crew and it stands out a mile. I thought this was a good flight."
,Couple Leisure,Business Class,San Diego to London,February 2019,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified | San Diego to London. From the moment that I boarded this flight (due to take off at 19.25), the crew had one interest and one only - to get the cabin lights off, which they duly achieved two hours later. As a consequence, the service was negligent in the extreme. This was a Club World ticket - so expensive and I looked forward to a decent level of service. However, I wasn't offered champagne on boarding, wine with my meal or coffee and port after my meal. I complained to BA when I got home but they weren't interested and I was met with a barrage of corporate platitudes. This flight was a disappointing end to what had been a great trip to the US & Mexico and has left me with a very poor view of the airline."

Flew BA new revamped business class today and a huge improvement on the old set up. Well lit cabin, improved seating comfort, better and operational entertainment system (always hit or miss before) and decent food. Cabin crew worked hard and were pleasant. I have observed along with everyone else the falling standards at BA and have moved most of my travel to rival airlines but on the basis of today’s experience I will consider them in the future. Much improved, well done."

,Business,Economy Class,London to Tampa,January 2019,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2,no,5.0,,"Not Verified |  London to Tampa. BA broke my suitcase and I did not make a fuss, I just got a new one. The new one was too large for the overhead bin on the return flight (the only suitcase I could purchase while abroad). So on top of the new suitcase, I had to actually pay BA to check the new bag. Cost me over $100 for their mistake. They also shovel off customer service to some company abroad. You will get an email a month later saying ""I'd like to know you that we are unable to offer refund"". Make a big fuss at the airport if they break your stuff so that you can avoid this black hole they call customer service.

Boeing 787,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to London Heathrow,February 2019,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2,no,1.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  My husband and I flew on British Airways flight BA-228 from Baltimore to London Heathrow leaving on the 12th February 2019. Every aspect of the flight was poorer than what budget airlines have to offer. The plane was shabby and dated. The seat reclining facility did not operate properly, was not that comfortable, and we had less legroom than the equivalent with budget airlines. The touch screen TV monitor was not working properly. One ear bud on the headphones did not work. The audio socket was too loose for the headphones so the plug kept falling out making it difficult to enjoy the in-flight entertainment (which in itself had a dated choice). The pillow was disgusting and kept falling out of the flimsy cover. The air conditioning lacked consistency alternating between very hot and very cold air. The restroom occupied sign always lit up as vacant even if it was occupied. However what made the flight very unpleasant was the bad attitude of the cabin crew. They were abrupt, unfriendly and quite clearly did not want to be there. There was one exception, an extremely pleasant older crew member who greeted us on and off the flight. There did not appear to be any organisation or smooth co-ordination when distributing the meals. Our two trays of food where placed on top of each other and practically thrown at us by a sour faced crew member. This flight was one hour late making us nervous about catching our connecting flight. There was no information or instructions given to us about connecting flight gate numbers before we landed. Unlike all the other airlines that I have travelled with there were no staff member greeting the connecting customers to point them in the right direction or re-assure them. British Airways would be my last choice of an airline to travel with and I would only fly with them again if there was no other option."
,Solo Leisure,First Class, Bridgetown to Gatwick,November 2018,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1,no,3.0,1.0,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bridgetown to Gatwick. I couldn't imagine that first class on BA would be the same as travelling in business class with for example Qatar, Emirates, Etihad, Singapore, Thai etc for double the price. Cabin, seats and food equals business class. One of the red wines on the wine list was out from start when I left London outbound. Cabin crew worked well and gave splendid service. But first class on BA is not worth the fare. When I complained to customer service after I got home, all I got was they are in the process of upgrading world traveller. "
A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Athens,December 2018,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2,no,1.0,1.0,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Athens. Classic BA love and hate relationship where one flight is perfect and another one is a total disaster. Problems in December 2018 at Heathrow check-in when BA check-in and baggage management IT systems went down for at least 90 minutes. Total chaos with people like myself arrived at the airport 2:30 hours before the flight and queuing while others arriving 45 minutes prior to their departure and given priority. Even though we were checked in at some point, the flight was delayed by 2+ hours on top of the problems. Then flight does not have enough food onboard. At least the crew clearly attempted to reduce flight time to the minimum."
,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to London,February 2019,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked a British Airways flight from Amsterdam to London Heathrow. In the beginning everything went normal and smooth. Check-in and boarding was easy and on time and once everyone boarded the problems started one after another. First an announcement was made by the pilot about a flight delay due to strong winds in Heathrow (fair enough). Afterwards the wind problem was resolved but a passenger decided to leave so they had to take out his luggage. After that we received a 3rd announcement stating there is a computer malfunction at Schiphol Airport and they are doing their best to resolve it. This caused us already about 45-60 mins delay but me and other passenger still remained calm and relaxed and then the hell started. We received permission to take off after 7 mins and then the pilot offered passengers who do not wish to travel to leave the plane. Of course there were many passengers who were travelling on business and I guess too delayed to make it on time for their meetings so they decided to leave. The crew warned them that this might cause terrible delay and problems for the other passengers but they still decided to leave. So a group of passengers left and we missed our opportunity to take off. Then the pilot announced that we can take off after 2,5 or 3 hours. The flight was full of overseas travellers. We spent 2 hours sitting in a plane which was not moving anywhere, people unboarded the plane 4 times in total and no food or water was offered to us. We had to line up next to the bathroom to purchase food and drinks and pay for it. The overall experience was terrible and it ruined the whole plan for my first day in London."

The nine hour flight was an amazing experience, with great legroom, reclining seat for a nice sleep and low noise. Definitely recommend and will be flying premium on long haul again."
Boeing 787-9,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Tokyo Narita to London Heathrow,January 2019,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4,yes,5.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  Tokyo to London. I was looking forward to this flight because of the Club World ticket and because it was my first time flying on a Boeing 787. We had a good check-in experience, breezed through the airport and enjoyed the JAL Lounge at Narita. We boarded on time and first impressions of the Boeing 787 were good: a modern plane with nice mood lighting as we boarded. The food and wines were really good. I had a beautifully-presented Japanese starter followed by a bento-style lunch as a final reminder of the holiday and my wife chose the western options. There was plenty of choice on the IFE and there was a big screen. On the downside, the cabin was too hot which made it difficult to sleep on the flight. This was a problem that we encountered on our outbound journey too. The seat was comfortable and reclined fully but I find the layout of BA Club World a little awkward because you have to step over another passenger's footrest to access the aisle. The cabin crew were efficient but seemed a bit exhausted and could have been more friendly and welcoming. The context to this review is that we spoiled ourselves and flew in first class on the way to Tokyo. We had an amazing experience with such comfortable seats and exemplary service from the cabin crew. We both felt a bit disappointed with the return flight in comparison and felt there was room for improvement, but at the same time our expectations might have been too high because of the previous flight."

My wife and I treated ourselves to first class flights for our holiday to Japan with the help of my Avios and a BA Amex companion voucher. We were very excited about flying first class and the dedicated check-in area at Heathrow was great. We boarded on time and the cabin did not disappoint. We had very grand seats with lovely surroundings. The cabin staff who looked after us were fantastic and really took the time to get to know us and understand what we wanted. The food and alcoholic drinks were great. I went for beef main course followed by the amazing chocolate and toffee pudding. I was ready to sleep after all that food but saw that there was lots of choice and a large screen for the IFE. My wife and I both said afterwards that it didn't feel like a long-haul flight because the time passed so quickly and comfortably. My only complaint is that the cabin was uncomfortably hot while we were cruising which made it harder to sleep.
,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Billund,February 2019,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was flying London to Billund today via British Airways and I was a bit hesitant as I’ve never flown with this airline, due to early morning traffic I was running a little behind schedule and I had a 23kg bag to also check in and check in closed 45 mins before my flight departs. Upon arrival I was greeted my a young gentlemen who was very helpful and respectful. He calmed me down and reassured me that everything was going to be okay ,as I was very very stressed thinking I was going to miss my flight. He then offered to give me fast track through security so I could get to my gate quicker. I just want to thank him again as he made my experience with British Airways like no other and I’m very grateful."
,Business,Premium Economy,San Diego to Frankfurt via London,February 2019,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2,no,1.0,3.0,"✅ Trip Verified |  San Diego to Frankfurt via London. It all started when trying to check in online 24h before departure from San Diego to Heathrow. On long flights like this I always reserve an aisle seat. Online Check-in did not work, no reason was given. Ok, let’s call US hotline. I tried at least 40 times. Answers were either, that call could not be completed, check number or due to heavy call volume they could not process call right now. I did not make it through. As an act of desperation I today called a British number. The lady told me guess what: no more aisle seats available. Some other numbers I tried were available on weekdays only, good to know if you need help on a Sunday. So I‘ve got the strong feeling, that they do not even care about there customers. B On my flight to San Diego 5 days ago, my TV screen was gone and there was no way to change seats. Great overall experience."

However on this occasion my baggage was lost on arrival at Gatwick.

When I arrived at the boarding gate in London to take my flight to Philadelphia they told me that there was no sufficient business seat available! They overbooked! My choice was then either to fly ecenomy or to take the next flight! They just did not care about their customer. No phone call, no email, no indication at the lounge nothing until I was at the boarding gate. I kindly accepted to take the next flight. The plane was delayed by 1 hour due to technical issues. When I arrived at Philadelphia, no suitcase! No British Airways desk on arrival, it was late no one could help. I finally retrieve my suitcase 3 days later: broken! During these 3 days, it was impossible to get someone on the phone. On my flight back to Geneva, same issue! no sufficient business class seats available. It is clear that this company just don't care about their customers, they just care about their money !"

A380,Family Leisure,Business Class,Johannesburg to London,February 2019,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3,yes,4.0,4.0,"✅ Trip Verified |  Johannesburg to London. At Johannesburg used BA galleries lounge which was fine if a little busy. Plane boarded on time, very hot due to lack of auxiliary power unit, given aircraft at JNB all day, perhaps this could have been addressed. After take off the crew dispensed with pre dinner drinks and went straight for meal. Portions of starter very small, I was given someone else’s by mistake which was then taken away and given to him. I thought that originally the idea of the new Club World meal involved a trolley service but no sign of that. Main was good (beef), dessert was cheese, very small basic selection. Then bed, gap in seat made lie flat less comfortable. Breakfast was ok. Delay with baggage due to another aircraft technical issue (there seemed to be a few of these). Arrivals lounge was good. Overall an average experience."

Rude staff, poor service, missing baggage, poor entertainment system. I spilled my drink and the attitude of the staff was brutal. I apologised for my clumsiness, but I was made to feel like I had deliberately done some shameful act in public and staff would not want to have anything to do with me. I asked for tissues and the answer was, get it from the toilet. The staff did not even have the courtesy to ask me if I needed another drink once I cleaned myself up. The crew were also extremely noisy. Chatting and laughing loudly at the pantry place for the entire duration. And then - while boarding at Edinburgh, they offered to check in my second bag for free because cabin was full. The staff wrote Bangalore via Heathrow, but my bag was not loaded to connecting flight. 4 hours gap mind you. "

Berlin to Johannesburg via London. The short haul flight between Berlin and London was oKay, they don't include drinks or snacks anymore on short distance flights and prices onboard for them are compared to some low-cost carriers high. Because of an engine problem, the flights from LHR to JNB was delayed by 2:45h. British Airways gave £5 vouchers out to compensate for snacks and drinks. Inside the A380, the IFE boxes under the window seats take a big part of the available leg space."

An extremely average flight. Nothing stood out as good and nothing stood out as bad. The flight was smooth and felt quite short. The cabin crew was helpful and everything was comfortable. The inflight entertainment needed some work.
,Business,Economy Class,London to Milan ,November 2018,3.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2,no,,1.0,"Not Verified |  I've always favoured British Airways and will always try and choose to fly with them, which is mostly decided by flight times for my business travel. I have always found it better value over the cheaper airlines via their additonal benefits like early check-in and on-flight catering, for economy. However BA have stripped both the above perks. I now struggle to see the value, and put their offering almost beside that of the likes of Easyjet, yet you pay almost double. Then today I flew back from Denmark with SAS, and it was amazing and made BA look cheap. Not only do you get a good meal on board, you get free drink, can charge your electronics and get wifi (for only 2.9 Euros!). Outstanding."

The plane was late, not an issue. But some flight attendants were not really friendly in their manner, they seemed in a rush to finish the service and then chill loudly. On a 7 hour flight, they served us the food 40mins after departure, then 20mins at the most after started clearing, we were not even close to finish eating. Then 5 mins after another staff member just came by an took most of the food we didnt even had time to tell him not to. This was really poor service. Especially to realise that because the aircraft was only half booked, they were actually rushing us to be able to stop serving and take a nap comfortably on the raws of empty seats next to us. Thats what you call bad customer service! ps: i was charged 100$ for a luggage, after buying my ticket 350$"
A380,Couple Leisure,First Class,Johannesburg to London ,January 2019,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3,yes,3.0,3.0,"✅ Trip Verified | A380 boarding is always a nightmare, but it was complicated on this occasion by multiple pax in wheelchairs and a delayed show-up by the pilots. Fortunately, we still managed to take off more or less on time. The cabin crew responsible for our side of the First cabin was personable but lacked experience. The food served for dinner was a mixture of good and mediocre. Warm salmon on ice cold salad is never a pleasant experience. The seats in First are reasonably comfortable although they lack the privacy of competitors' premium cabin. The duvet was made redundant because of the typically overheated cabin. One of the First toilets was out of action so we had to make use of the Club World loos upstairs. It would have been helpful if cabin crew had apologised for the inconvenience for the lack of the convenience, but no comment was made. The IFE was passable and the sound quality good if one's own noise cancelling headphones are used. WiFi was available but I didn't make use of it. Breakfast was unremarkable and I wish bread rather than pastries was offered. Deplaning was delayed by half-an-hour because of early morning congestion at T5 and the lack of a stand. Overall, a reasonable flight but not first class."
